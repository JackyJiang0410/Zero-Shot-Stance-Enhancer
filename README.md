# Zero-Shot Stance Detection Enhanced with Background Knowledge

This repository contains the implementation of a zero-shot stance detection model enhanced with background knowledge, as described in the paper "Zero-Shot Stance Detection Enhanced with Augmented Background Knowledge" by Jacky Jiang, Jerry Wei, and Lize Shao from Rice University.

## Introduction

The goal of stance detection is to identify a textâ€™s stance towards a particular topic without having seen examples of the stance during training. Our approach improves zero-shot stance detection by incorporating additional background knowledge, categorized into topic-related and expression-related knowledge. Using retrieval-enhanced generation techniques, we collect topic-related knowledge from Wikipedia and provide expression-related knowledge specific to jargon used in online communication.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers by Hugging Face
- tqdm
- scikit-learn
- faiss
- tensorboardX

You can install the required packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install torch transformers tqdm scikit-learn faiss-cpu tensorboardX
```

## Usage
### Dataset Preparation
Ensure your dataset is formatted according to the expectations of the script. Example datasets can be found in the ./datasets folder with the appropriate structure.

### Training and Testing the Model
To run the training and testing of the model, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model_name bert-scl --dataset covid --target "stay at home orders" --output_par_dir test_outputs
```

You can customize the training by specifying additional command line arguments. Here are some key arguments you might consider:

- `--model_name`: Model to use (default: bert-scl).
- `--dataset`: Dataset to use (choices: semeval16, covid).
- `--target`: Specific target within the dataset for stance detection.
- `--output_par_dir`: Parent directory to save outputs.

### Custom Configuration
Modify the script's argument parser setup in `main.py` to include any additional or custom configurations specific to your needs.

## Output
The output includes the trained model, logs, and performance metrics which are saved in the specified output directory.
