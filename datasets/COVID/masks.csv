Valuable background information is the stigma surrounding the usage of face masks in the Western world, where wearing a mask is often seen as a sign of sickness. This stigma could lead people to feel ashamed and opt not to wear a mask in public. Additionally, men may be more likely to feel negative emotions and stigma associated with wearing masks. There is also an association between covering one's face and negative connotations like criminals or hiding something shameful."
