The differentiation between lockdown and stay-at-home orders lies in the fact that residents are allowed limited movement under the latter. An example of stringent measures during the pandemic is the 2020 Singapore circuit breaker, which can be categorized as a form of lockdown."

The term ""lockdown"" was widely used by the media to describe government actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though it is not a precise public health or legal term. Additional actions associated with lockdown procedures include hiding, locking doors, turning off lights, and staying away from windows. It's essential to note that lockdowns can sometimes be associated with martial law, restricting people from leaving their homes. The 2020 Singapore circuit breaker measures serve as an example of a lockdown implemented in response to the pandemic."

Amidst the global response to the COVID-19 crisis, many countries, including the United Kingdom, enforced stay-at-home orders, curfews, and quarantines as part of their measures to contain the virus spread.
