Some falsely claimed he was involved in creating the virus in a Chinese lab. After Joe Biden took office, Fauci began serving as one of the lead members of the White House COVID-19 Response Team. Fauci is additionally serving as Biden's chief medical advisor.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAnthony Fauci was born on December 24, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Eugenia Lillian (n\u00e9e Abys; 1909\u20131965) and Stephen A. Fauci (1910\u20132008). His father was a Columbia University-educated pharmacist who owned his own pharmacy. Fauci's mother and sister worked the pharmacy's register and Fauci delivered prescriptions. The pharmacy was located in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, directly beneath the family apartment, previously in the Bensonhurst neighborhood.Fauci's grandparents immigrated to the United States from Italy in the late 19th century. His paternal grandparents, Antonino Fauci and Calogera Guardino, were from Sciacca, and his maternal grandparents were from Naples. His maternal grandmother Raffaella Trematerra was a seamstress, and his maternal grandfather Giovanni Abys was a Swiss-born artist noted for his landscape and portrait painting, magazine illustrations in Italy, as well as graphic design for commercial labels, including olive oil cans. Fauci grew up Catholic, but now considers himself a humanist, stating that he thinks \"that there are a lot of things about organized religion that are unfortunate, and [that he tends] to like to stay away from it.\" In 2021, he was named Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.Fauci attended Regis High School, a private Jesuit school in Manhattan's Upper East Side, where he captained the school's basketball team despite standing only 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall. After graduating in 1958, Fauci attended the College of the Holy Cross, graduating in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in classics with a pre-med track. Fauci then attended Cornell University's Medical College (now Weill Cornell Medicine), graduating with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1966 ranked first in his class. He then did an internship and residency in internal medicine at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (now Weill Cornell Medical Center).\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAfter completing his medical residency in 1968, Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a clinical associate in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases's (NIAID) Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI). He became head of the LCI's Clinical Physiology Section in 1974, and in 1980 was appointed chief of the NIAID's Laboratory of Immunoregulation. He became director of the NIAID in 1984, a position he still holds. Fauci has been offered the position of director of the NIH several times, but has declined each time.Fauci has been at the forefront of U.S. efforts to contend with viral diseases like HIV/AIDS, SARS, the Swine flu, MERS, Ebola, and COVID-19. He played a significant role in the early 2000s in creating the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and in driving development of biodefense drugs and vaccines following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Fauci has been a visiting professor at many medical centers and has received numerous honorary doctorates from universities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\n=== Medical achievements ===\n\nFauci has made important scientific observations that contributed to the understanding of the regulation of the human immune response and is recognized for delineating the mechanisms whereby immunosuppressive agents adapt to that response. He developed therapies for formerly fatal diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. In a 1985 Stanford University Arthritis Center Survey, members of the American Rheumatism Association ranked Fauci's work on the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis as one of the most important advances in patient management in rheumatology over the previous 20 years.\n\nFauci has contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body's natural defense system, progressing to AIDS. He has outlined the mechanisms of induction of HIV expression by endogenous cytokines. Fauci has worked to develop strategies for the therapy and immune reconstitution of patients with the disease, as well as for a vaccine to prevent HIV infection. His current research is concentrated on identifying the nature of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection and the scope of the body's immune responses to HIV.\nIn 2003, the Institute for Scientific Information stated that from 1983 to 2002, \"Fauci was the 13th most-cited scientist among the 2.5 to 3.0 million authors in all disciplines throughout the world who published articles in scientific journals.\" As a government scientist under seven presidents, Fauci has been described as \"a consistent spokesperson for science, a person who more than any other figure has brokered a generational peace\" between the two worlds of science and politics.\n\n\n=== Patents ===\n\n\n=== HIV/AIDS epidemic ===\n\nIn a 2020 interview with The Guardian, Fauci remarked, \"My career and my identity has really been defined by HIV.\" He was one of the leading researchers during the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. In 1981, he and his team of researchers began looking for a vaccine or treatment for this novel virus, though they would meet a number of obstacles. In October 1988, protesters came to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute's director in 1984, bore the brunt of the anger from the LGBTQ+ community who were largely ignored by the government.Leading AIDS activist Larry Kramer attacked Fauci relentlessly in the media. He called him an \"incompetent idiot\" and a \"pill-pushing\" tool of the medical establishment. Fauci did not have control over drug approval though many people felt he was not doing enough. Fauci did make an effort in the late 1980s to reach out to the LGBTQ+ community in New York and San Francisco to find ways he and the NIAID could find a solution. Though Fauci was initially admonished for his treatment of the AIDS epidemic, his work in the community was eventually acknowledged. Kramer, who had spent years hating Fauci for his treatment of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, eventually called him \"the only true and great hero\" among government officials during the AIDS crisis.Political commentator Helen Andrews defended Fauci's actions during the epidemic in a 2021 article, writing:\n\nThe idea that Fauci was \"wrong\" about A.I.D.S., which some of his contemporary opponents repeat, is unfair. His most notorious error was a 1983 paper suggesting \"routine close contact, as within a family household,\" might spread the disease, but it was an understandable mistake given what was known at the time and he corrected it within a year, lightning speed by the standards of academic publishing. He behaved more responsibly than some of his peers when it came to speculating about a heterosexual A.I.D.S. epidemic around the corner. He was not one of the hysteria-mongers\u2014though he did benefit from the hysteria when negotiating budgets with Congress.\n\n\n=== 2009 swine flu pandemic ===\nIn a meeting with reporters on September 17, 2009, Fauci predicted that the H1N1 virus causing the 2009 swine flu pandemic could infect as many as one in three Americans, more than the amount of Americans usually infected by the seasonal flu.\n\n\n=== Ebola congressional hearing ===\n\nOn October 16, 2014, in a United States congressional hearing regarding the Ebola virus crisis, Fauci, who, as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) had been discussing the importance of screening for weeks, testified that NIAID was still some distance away from producing sufficient quantities of cures or vaccines for widespread trials. Specifically, Fauci said, \"While NIAID is an active participant in the global effort to address the public health emergency occurring in west Africa, it is important to recognize that we are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented.\"Fauci also remarked in the hearing: \"As we continue to expedite research while enforcing high safety and efficacy standards, the implementation of the public health measures already known to contain prior Ebola virus outbreaks and the implementation of treatment strategies such as fluid and electrolyte replacement is essential to preventing additional infections, treating those already infected, protecting healthcare providers, and ultimately bringing this epidemic to an end.\"\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\n\n==== Trump administration ====\n\nFauci was a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force established in late January 2020, under President Donald Trump, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. He became a de facto public health spokesperson for the office of the president during the pandemic, and a strong advocate for ongoing social distancing efforts in the United States.In interviews on January 21, January 26, and February 17, Fauci commented on COVID-19. He said that at the time of the interviews (\"right now\"), COVID-19 was not a \"major threat\" to the American public, with the risk to the American public being \"low\", but that it was \"an evolving situation\", and that \"public health officials need to take [COVID-19] very seriously\". In the latter interview, Fauci said that COVID-19 could become a \"global pandemic which would then have significant implications for\" the United States.In March 2020, he predicted that the infection fatality rate would likely be close to 1%, which was ten times more severe than the 0.1% reported rate for seasonal flu.In a March 8, 2020, interview, Fauci stated that \"right now in the United States, people [who are not infected] should not be walking around with masks\", but \"if you want to do it, that's fine\". In the same interview, Fauci said that buying masks \"could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need\" them: \"When you think masks, you should think of healthcare providers needing them\". When Fauci made this comment, America's top surgical mask maker was struggling to produce enough masks to meet the increased demand. On April 3, the CDC reversed course, quoting recent studies that showed asymptomatic transmission of the virus, thus advocating for the public to wear non-surgical masks to reduce community transmission, while Fauci advocated for wearing facial coverings in public.In mid-April, when asked about social distancing and stay-at-home measures, Fauci said that if the administration had \"started mitigation earlier\" more lives could have been saved, and \"no one is going to deny that.\" He added that the decision-making for implementing mitigation measures was \"complicated\", and \"there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.\"Fauci's comments were met with a hostile response from former Republican congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine. Trump retweeted Lorraine's response, which included the call to \"#FireFauci\", drawing public alarm. \"Fire Fauci\" has also been chanted by anti-lockdown protesters in various locations, including Florida and Texas. As a result, the White House denied that Trump was firing Fauci, and blamed the media for overreacting.Due to Trump's opposition to CDC mask wearing guidelines and social distancing measures, which Fauci advocated, Fauci was  criticized by right-wing pundits and received death threats that necessitated a security detail. In an interview with 60 Minutes in 2020, he mentioned that other members of his family, including his wife and daughters, had been repeatedly harassed since the pandemic began.\n\nIn June 2020, Fauci said that he was \"very concerned\" that the ongoing protests against police brutality would cause \"surges\" in COVID-19 cases, stating that the \"large crowds\" are a \"perfect set-up\" for the virus to spread. In July 2020, Fauci advised the public to \"avoid crowds of any type\".On July 6, 2020, Fauci spoke on a Facebook livestream, offering his opinion that the country's situation pertaining to COVID-19 \"is really not good\", pointing to more than 55,000 new cases on July 4, 2020. He said the United States was \"still knee-deep in the first wave\" of cases, and was experiencing a \"resurgence of infections\". On July 7, 2020, during a press conference, Fauci stated that it was a \"false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death\" for COVID-19 in the country: \"There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into false complacency.\" Both Trump and the White House had cited the falling death rate as proof of success of the Trump administration's response. After this appearance by Fauci, the White House cancelled three media appearances that had been scheduled for him later that week. On July 7, 2020, Trump contradicted Fauci's comments describing a dire situation in the country, with Trump saying: \"I think we are in a good place. I disagree with [Fauci].\" While there were disagreements, Trump also at times praised Fauci.On July 9, 2020, Trump publicly claimed that Fauci \"made a lot of mistakes\". By July 12, 2020, a White House official told media outlets that \"several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things\", passing to the media a list of purported mistakes made by Fauci during the outbreak. One of the supposed mistakes highlighted was Fauci's February 29, 2020, statement in an interview that \"at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing on a day-by-day basis.\" However, the White House list neglected to mention that in that same interview, Fauci had stated that the risk could change, \"when you start to see community spread\", and that the disease could morph into \"a major outbreak\" in the country.As late as September 23, 2020, when U.S. coronavirus fatalities exceeded 200,000, conservatives continued to question Fauci's and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendations for responding to the pandemic. In a hearing before the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Kentucky's Senator Rand Paul asked him if he had \"second thoughts\" about his mitigation recommendations, including keeping six feet of distance from others and mask-wearing, claiming, \"our death rate is essentially worse than Sweden's.\" Fauci stood by the guidelines, indicating Sweden's fatality rate exceeded those of other Scandinavian countries, and said the comparison between Sweden and the U.S. was not legitimate. Fauci said the recommendations remained valid. After Paul then asserted New York's high fatality rate showed that mitigation efforts were insufficient, Fauci replied, \"You've misconstrued that, Senator, and you've done that repetitively in the past.\" Fauci explained further that New York State had succeeded in getting the virus under control by following the CDC's clinical guidelines. Paul had made numerous claims about herd immunity, Sweden's interventions to combat the pandemic, the contention that the populations of Asian countries have greater resilience against COVID-19, and statements about death rates due to the virus.In October 2020, Fauci objected after his words \"I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more\" were featured in an advertisement from the Trump campaign touting Trump's handling of the pandemic. Fauci said he did not consent to the ad, his words were taken out of context (he was actually referring to how hard the Coronavirus Task Force was working), and he had never made a political endorsement in his career.On October 18, 2020, Fauci mentioned that he \"wasn't surprised\" Donald Trump contracted COVID-19. The next day, during a presidential call, Trump called Fauci \"a disaster\" and said that \"people are tired of COVID.\" During a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 19, Trump launched attacks on his political rival Joe Biden, saying that Biden \"wants to listen to Dr. Fauci\" regarding the handling of the pandemic, upon which Biden merely replied \"Yes\" on Twitter. On October 31, The Washington Post published an extensive interview with Fauci, in which he voiced a candid assessment of the administration's COVID-19 policies and was critical of the influence of presidential advisor Scott Atlas.Shortly after midnight on November 2, 2020, Trump insinuated he would fire Fauci \"after the election\" while on stage at a campaign rally at Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport in Opa-locka, Florida. At the rally, he made false claims that the pandemic was \"rounding the turn\" and was met by audience chants of \"Fire Fauci!\", to which he responded \"Don't tell anybody, but let me wait until after the election ... I appreciate the advice.\" Despite the rhetoric, Fauci was not fired.\nOn December 2, the United Kingdom became the first western country to license a vaccine against the coronavirus (Pfizer-BioNTech). In response, Fauci said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was proceeding \"the correct way\" and said the U.K. \"really rushed through that approval\". The next day Fauci apologized, telling the BBC \"I have a great deal of confidence in what the U.K. does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint. Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the U.K. ... I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way.\"On January 3, 2021, President Trump tweeted, \"The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of [the CDC's] ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries\". That same morning, Fauci responded in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, \"The numbers are real. We have well over 300,000 deaths. We are averaging two- to three thousand deaths per day. All you need to do ... is go into the trenches, go into the hospitals, go into the intensive care units and see what is happening. Those are real numbers, real people and real deaths.\"When asked if the 2021 United States Capitol attack was a COVID-19 superspreader event, Fauci stated: \"I think for those people there, they probably put themselves at an increased risk because they essentially did not adhere to the fundamentals of public health and COVID-19 context which is universal wearing of masks, keeping physical distance, avoiding crowds in congregate settings. The fact that it was outdoors is a little bit better than if they were indoors completely. But you can still have a super spreader situation when you do things in a crowded way.\"On January 23, 2021, Fauci was quoted saying that letting the science speak on the pandemic got him \"into a little bit of trouble\" and got \"push-back from people in the White House, including the president\", during the Trump administration. Fauci was also reportedly blocked from appearing on The Rachel Maddow Show for some time because the Trump administration \"didn't like the way [Maddow handles] things and they didn't want me on [the show].\"\n\n\n==== Biden administration ====\n\nOn December 3, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden asked Fauci, in addition to remaining in his role as director of the NIAID, to serve as the chief medical advisor to the president in the Biden administration. Fauci accepted the offer.After the inauguration of Joe Biden in January 2021, Fauci said he experienced a \"liberating feeling\" in being able to speak freely about science without interference from the new administration. He pictured Biden's administration as committed to being \"completely transparent, open and honest\". In early April 2021, Fauci said of the current situation in the United States that \"It's almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase\".In early May 2021, when asked if the CDC's summer camp guidance was excessive, Fauci responded by saying that \"I wouldn't call them excessive, but they certainly are conservative\" and added that the guidance \"looks a bit strict\" and \"a bit stringent\". Also in early May, Fauci said that he is \"not convinced\" that COVID-19 originated naturally and that \"we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened\". In mid-May 2021, Fauci said that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no longer need to wear masks outdoors, except for in \"completely crowded situations\". This guidance was updated in July 2021 to recommend that all people wear masks regardless of vaccination status, in what Fauci said was due to the much more contagious Delta variant.In May 2021, Fauci denied that the National Institutes of Health supported \"gain-of-function research\" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.In early June 2021, over 3,000 internal government emails sent by Fauci from January to June 2020 were obtained by media outlets through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These emails contain information about how the United States and Fauci initially responded to COVID-19.On June 22, 2021, Fauci said that the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is the \"greatest threat\" to eliminating COVID-19 in the United States.In December 2021, Fauci, along with virologist Jeffery K. Taubenberger and David M. Morens endorsed the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine, advocating in favor of \"an international collaborative effort to extensively sample coronaviruses from bats as well as wild and farmed animals to help understand the full \"universe\" of existing and emerging coronaviruses.\"In February 2022, Fauci told the Financial Times that \"As we get out of the full-blown pandemic phase of Covid-19, which we are certainly heading out of, these decisions will increasingly be made on a local level rather than centrally decided or mandated. There will also be more people making their own decisions on how they want to deal with the virus.\"\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nOwing to his prominent role in the United States response to numerous global pandemics, most notably HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, Fauci has become the subject of tributes and interpretations across various media, including television, literature, merchandising, and internet memes. Brad Pitt's performance as Fauci during the 2020 season of Saturday Night Live earned the actor an Emmy nomination, and praise from Fauci. Author Sally Quinn has credited Fauci as the inspiration for the love interest to the protagonist in her bestselling 1991 romance novel Happy Endings. Larry Kramer based the character Dr. Anthony Della Vida on Fauci in his play The Destiny of Me.In the spring of 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, bakeries across the United States began selling pastries, particularly donuts, with Fauci's face on them to pay tribute to his work in the public health sector.In September 2021, Fauci, a documentary film about Fauci's life and career, was released by Magnolia Pictures. The film was produced by National Geographic Documentary Films.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1985, Fauci married Christine Grady, a nurse and bioethicist with the NIH, after they met while treating a patient. Grady is chief of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Together they have three adult daughters.\n\n\n== Memberships ==\nFauci is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Philosophical Society, and the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, as well as other numerous professional societies including the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Association of Immunologists. He serves on the editorial boards of many scientific journals, as an editor of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, and as an author, coauthor, or editor of more than 1,000 scientific publications, including several textbooks. On March 23, 2021, Fauci was admitted as an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n1979: Arthur S.

In January 2017, Watters' World became weekly, and in April 2017, he became a co-host of the roundtable series The Five. In 2022, Watters became host of Jesse Watters Primetime.\nIn 2021, he published his first book, How I Saved the World. The work debuted at number one on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWatters was born in July 1978 and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, son of Stephen Hapgood Watters, a teacher, and child psychologist Anne Purvis, daughter of Morton Bailey, Jr., publisher of Better Homes and Gardens magazine. Her grandfather, Morton Bailey, published The Saturday Evening Post; his father was the politician Morton S. Bailey. Watters's paternal grandfather, Dr Franklin Benjamin Watters, was a cardiologist at the Veterans Administration Hospital at Newington, Connecticut, and a professor at the University of Connecticut Medical Dental School. He has some Irish ancestry on his father's side. Watters is named after his mother's great-grandfather Jesse Andrew Burnett, an associate chief justice of the Kansas Supreme Court.Watters grew up in the Germantown and then East Falls neighborhoods. He attended the William Penn Charter School through junior year, before moving with his family to Long Island in New York. In 2001, he graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, with a B.A. in history.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter his graduation, Watters began work as a production assistant at Fox News. In 2003, he moved to the production staff of The O'Reilly Factor, and in 2004 he began to appear on air in segments of O'Reilly's show.On June 11, 2014, Watters debuted on the Fox News show Outnumbered, later occasionally appearing as a guest co-host. On November 20, 2015, Watters debuted his own monthly Fox News program, Watters' World. While Watters is characterized as an \"ambush journalist\", Watters has said, \"I try to make it enjoyable for the person I'm interviewing. We always come away from the interview all smiles, for the most part. And it's always fun to come back and look at the footage and say, 'Oh my gosh, what just happened?'\" In January 2017, Watters' World became a weekly show, airing Saturdays at 8 p.m. ET.In April 2017, Watters became a co-host of the roundtable series The Five.\nIn April 2021, HarperCollins announced the publication of Watters' new book How I Saved the World, which was published on July 6. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for the week ending July 10, 2021.After serving as one of several rotating fill-in hosts in the network's 7 PM time slot, it was announced on January 10, 2022, that Watters would become the permanent host on January 24, and the show will be titled Jesse Watters Primetime. While he will remain on The Five, Watters\u2019 World will end and be replaced.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn January 2017, Watters faulted John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, for the theft of Podesta's emails by Russian hackers, saying, \"What happened was John Podesta gave his password to a hacker. And guess what his password was. 'Password.' It's a true story. His password was 'password.'\" The fact-checking website PolitiFact rated Watters' claim \"False.\"\n\n\n=== Amanda Terkel \"ambush\" ===\nIn 2009, on assignment for The O'Reilly Factor, Watters and his cameraman accosted journalist Amanda Terkel while she was on vacation to ask her questions about an article she wrote that was critical of Bill O'Reilly.\nSeven years later, at a journalists' reception, The Huffington Post's Ryan Grim approached Watters with his phone camera running and asked him to walk over to Terkel and apologize. Watters at first said he would apologize and then said he wouldn't, adding, \"I ambushed her because O'Reilly told me to get her because she said some bad shit.\"Video of the incident shows Watters then grabbing Grim's phone and throwing it on the floor, and later grabbing it again and putting it in his pocket. Eventually, the two got into a shoving match, as Grim attempted to recover his phone. Watters later commented on the incident on The O'Reilly Factor, stating, \"I was at this party trying to enjoy myself. This guy came up to me. He starts putting it in my face.\"Terkel wrote that Watters' response was \"surprising,\" considering that \"Watters' way of confronting his subjects is to thrust cameras in their faces unexpectedly and pepper them with aggressive questions.\"\n\n\n=== Chinatown segment ===\nIn October 2016, Watters was criticized for a segment of Watters' World that was widely considered racist toward Asian Americans. In New York City's Chinatown, Watters asked Chinese Americans if they knew karate (which originates from Japan, not China), if he should bow before he greets them, or if their watches were stolen. Throughout the segment, the 1974 song \"Kung Fu Fighting\" plays in the background, and the interviews are interspersed with references to martial arts and clips of Watters getting a foot massage and playing with nunchucks. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio denounced Watters' segment as \"vile, racist behavior\" that \"has no place in our city\". Numerous other lawmakers and journalists, including Asian Americans Mazie Hirono and Judy Chu, also condemned Watters. The segment was also criticized by the Asian American Journalists Association, which issued a statement saying, \"We should be far beyond tired, racist stereotypes and targeting an ethnic group for humiliation and objectification on the basis of their race.\"On October 5, Watters tweeted what Variety's Will Thorne called a \"non-apology\" about the segment. In the two tweets, Watters stated that \"My man-on-the-street interviews are meant to be taken as tongue-in-cheek and I regret if anyone found offense. ... As a political humorist, the Chinatown segment was intended to be a light piece, as all Watters' World segments are.\"\n\n\n=== Ivanka Trump comments ===\nIn April 2017, two days after joining The Five as co-host, Watters made an on-air comment about Ivanka Trump that was criticized as lewd. After viewing footage of Trump speaking on a panel about female entrepreneurship, Watters commented, \"So I don't really get what's going on here, but I really liked how she was speaking into that microphone,\" as he parodied holding the microphone as a phallic symbol. Watters denied his comment was sexual, saying in a statement: \"During the break we were commenting on Ivanka's voice and how it was low and steady and resonates like a smooth jazz radio DJ... This was in no way a joke about anything else.\" In response to the criticism, Watters was not on the show for two days that week.\n\n\n=== QAnon comments ===\nIn July 2020, Jesse Watters praised the conspiracy theory QAnon during his show, saying: \"they've also uncovered a lot of great stuff when it comes to Epstein and it comes to the deep state. I never saw Q as dangerous as antifa.\" After public backlash, Watters released a statement saying: \"I mentioned the conspiracy group QAnon, which I don\u2019t support or believe in. My comments should not be mistaken for giving credence to this fringe platform.\"\n\n\n=== Anthony Fauci comments ===\nAt Turning Point USA\u2019s 2022 AmericaFest conference, while advocating for attendees to aggressively confront and question Dr. Anthony Fauci about his alleged funding of gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Watters said, \"Now you go in for the kill shot. The kill shot? With an ambush? Deadly. Because he doesn't see it coming.\" Fauci responded that Watters' remarks were \"awful\" and that Watters \"should be fired on the spot\". Fox News indicated their support for Watters, saying he \"was using a metaphor\", and that his comments \"had been twisted completely out of context\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWatters is registered to vote as a member of the Conservative Party of New York State. He married Noelle Inguagiato in 2009 and had twin daughters with her. Noelle filed for divorce in 2018 after Watters admitted to an affair with a producer on his show, Emma DiGiovine. Their divorce was finalized in March 2019. Watters announced his engagement to DiGiovine in August 2019 and they married in December of the same year. Their son was born in 2021.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWatters, Jesse (2021). How I Saved the World. New York: Broadside Books. ISBN 978-0-06-304908-6.

When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of AIDS.\n\n\n== Virology ==\n\n\n=== Classification ===\n\nHIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and biological properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, integrase, and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system, for an indeterminate amount of time. The HIV virus can remain dormant in the human body for up to ten years after primary infection; during this period the virus does not cause symptoms. Alternatively, the integrated viral DNA may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins, using host cell resources, that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that will begin the replication cycle anew.\nTwo types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was initially discovered and termed both lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) and human T-lymphotropic virus 3 (HTLV-III). HIV-1 is more virulent and more infective than HIV-2, and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2, compared to HIV-1, implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Due to its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.\n\n\n=== Structure and genome ===\n\nHIV is different in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120 nm, around 60 times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive-sense single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed for the development of the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.This is, in turn, surrounded by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human host cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules that anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell's membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.\n\nAs the sole viral protein on the surface of the virus, the envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric envelope spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on human glycoproteins that are secreted or present on a cell surface. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to, or are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.The molecular structure of the viral spike has now been determined by X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy. These advances in structural biology were made possible due to the development of stable recombinant forms of the viral spike by the introduction of an intersubunit disulphide bond and an isoleucine to proline mutation (radical replacement of an amino acid) in gp41. The so-called SOSIP trimers not only reproduce the antigenic properties of the native viral spike, but also display the same degree of immature glycans as presented on the native virus. Recombinant trimeric viral spikes are promising vaccine candidates as they display less non-neutralising epitopes than recombinant monomeric gp120, which act to suppress the immune response to target epitopes.\n\nThe RNA genome consists of at least seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of tat, env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.The two tat proteins (p16 and p14) are transcriptional transactivators for the LTR promoter acting by binding the TAR RNA element. The TAR may also be processed into microRNAs that regulate the apoptosis genes ERCC1 and IER3. The rev protein (p19) is involved in shuttling RNAs from the nucleus and the cytoplasm by binding to the RRE RNA element. The vif protein (p23) prevents the action of APOBEC3G (a cellular protein that deaminates cytidine to uridine in the single-stranded viral DNA and/or interferes with reverse transcription).  The vpr protein (p14) arrests cell division at G2/M. The nef protein (p27) down-regulates CD4 (the major viral receptor), as well as the MHC class I and class II molecules.Nef also interacts with SH3 domains. The vpu protein (p16) influences the release of new virus particles from infected cells. The ends of each strand of HIV RNA contain an RNA sequence called a long terminal repeat (LTR). Regions in the LTR act as switches to control production of new viruses and can be triggered by proteins from either HIV or the host cell. The Psi element is involved in viral genome packaging and recognized by gag and rev proteins. The SLIP element (TTTTTT) is involved in the frameshift in the gag-pol reading frame required to make functional pol.\n\n\n=== Tropism ===\n\nThe term viral tropism refers to the cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells' membrane and also with chemokine co-receptors.Macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1, or non-syncytia-inducing strains (NSI; now called R5 viruses) use the \u03b2-chemokine receptor, CCR5, for entry and are thus able to replicate in both macrophages and CD4+ T cells. This CCR5 co-receptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates regardless of viral genetic subtype. Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4+ cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the central nervous system. In the tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus.\nT-tropic strains of HIV-1, or syncytia-inducing strains (SI; now called X4 viruses) replicate in primary CD4+ T cells as well as in macrophages and use the \u03b1-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, for entry.Dual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of HIV-1 and thus are able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors for viral entry.\nThe \u03b1-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of HIV target cells. M-tropic HIV-1 isolates that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of co-receptors alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.\nSome people are resistant to certain strains of HIV. For example, people with the CCR5-\u039432 mutation are resistant to infection by the R5 virus, as the mutation leaves HIV unable to bind to this co-receptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.\nSexual intercourse is the major mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV are present in the seminal fluid, which enables the virus to be transmitted from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. HIV-positive patients acquire an enormously broad spectrum of opportunistic infections, which was particularly problematic prior to the onset of HAART therapies; however, the same infections are reported among HIV-infected patients examined post-mortem following the onset of antiretroviral therapies. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.HIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1 and is restricted in its worldwide distribution to West Africa. The adoption of \"accessory genes\" by HIV-2 and its more promiscuous pattern of co-receptor usage (including CD4-independence) may assist the virus in its adaptation to avoid innate restriction factors present in host cells. Adaptation to use normal cellular machinery to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host, but ultimately become a commensal organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants that are more successful at transmission will be selected.\n\n\n=== Replication cycle ===\n\n\n==== Entry to the cell ====\n\nThe HIV virion enters macrophages and CD4+ T cells by the adsorption of glycoproteins on its surface to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane and the release of the HIV capsid into the cell.Entry to the cell begins through interaction of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike) on the HIV viral envelope and both CD4 and a chemokine co-receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4, but others are known to interact) on the target cell surface. Gp120 binds to integrin \u03b14\u03b27 activating LFA-1, the central integrin involved in the establishment of virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1. The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.The first step in fusion involves the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine receptor binding domains of gp120 and allowing them to interact with the target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin shape. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.After HIV has bound to the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell. During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.\nHIV can infect dendritic cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, but another route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN can also be used. DCs are one of the first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought to play an important role by transmitting HIV to T cells when the virus is captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.\n\nHIV-1 entry, as well as entry of many other retroviruses, has long been believed to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane. More recently, however, productive infection by pH-independent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of HIV-1 has also been reported and was recently suggested to constitute the only route of productive entry.\n\n\n==== Replication and transcription ====\n\nShortly after the viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse transcriptase liberates the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies it into a complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.The integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection. To actively produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors need to be present, the most important of which is NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa B), which is upregulated when T cells become activated. This means that those cells most likely to be targeted, entered and subsequently killed by HIV are those actively fighting infection.\nDuring viral replication, the integrated DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA. The full-length genomic RNAs (gRNA) can be packaged into new viral particles in a pseudodiploid form. The selectivity in the packaging is explained by the structural properties of the dimeric conformer of the gRNA. The gRNA dimer is characterized  by a tandem three-way junction within the gRNA monomer, in which the SD and AUG hairpins, responsible for splicing and translation respectively, are sequestered and the DIS (dimerization initiation signal) hairpin is exposed.The formation of the gRNA dimer is mediated by a \u2018kissing\u2019  interaction between the DIS hairpin loops of the gRNA monomers. At the same time, certain guanosine residues in the gRNA are made available for binding of the nucleocapsid (NC) protein leading to the subsequent virion assembly. The labile gRNA dimer has been also reported to achieve a more stable conformation following the NC binding, in which both the DIS and the U5:AUG regions of the gRNA participate in extensive base pairing.RNA can also be processed to produce mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In most cases, this processing involves RNA splicing to produce mRNAs that are shorter than the full-length genome. Which part of the RNA is removed during RNA splicing determines which of the HIV protein-coding sequences is translated.Mature HIV mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated to produce HIV proteins, including Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein is produced it moves to the nucleus, where it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.\nHIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to package their RNA differently. HIV-1 will bind to any appropriate RNA. HIV-2 will preferentially bind to the mRNA that was used to create the Gag protein itself.\n\n\n==== Recombination ====\n\nTwo RNA genomes are encapsidated in each HIV-1 particle (see Structure and genome of HIV). Upon infection and replication catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, recombination between the two genomes can occur. Recombination occurs as the single-strand, positive-sense RNA genomes are reverse transcribed to form DNA. During reverse transcription, the nascent DNA can switch multiple times between the two copies of the viral RNA. This form of recombination is known as copy-choice. Recombination events may occur throughout the genome. Anywhere from two to 20 recombination events per genome may occur at each replication cycle, and these events can rapidly shuffle the genetic information that is transmitted from parental to progeny genomes.Viral recombination produces genetic variation that likely contributes to the evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.Bonhoeffer et al. suggested that template switching by reverse transcriptase acts as a repair process to deal with breaks in the single-stranded RNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin suggested that recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged single-stranded RNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized whether or not the two genomes differ genetically. On the view that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.HIV-1 infection causes chronic inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damage, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, as well as for viruses in general, successful infection depends on overcoming host defense strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen species. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damage, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.\n\n\n==== Assembly and release ====\n\nThe final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by furin resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120. These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the gag polyproteins still need to be cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by antiretroviral drugs of the protease inhibitor class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion. Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.\n\n\n=== Spread within the body ===\n\nThe classical process of infection of a cell by a virion can be called \"cell-free spread\" to distinguish it from a more recently recognized process called \"cell-to-cell spread\". In cell-free spread (see figure), virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood or extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread, for which two pathways have been described. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as a macrophage or dendritic cell, can transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer is reported to be much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells, which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell towards the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues, where CD4+ T cells are densely packed and likely to interact frequently. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The many dissemination mechanisms available to HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication in spite of anti-retroviral therapies.\n\n\n=== Genetic variability ===\n\nHIV differs from many viruses in that it has very high genetic variability. This diversity is a result of its fast replication cycle, with the generation of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10\u22125 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.This complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.The closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has evolved into many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the African green monkey (SIVagm) and sooty mangabey (SIVsmm) are thought to have a long evolutionary history with their hosts. These hosts have adapted to the presence of the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood, but evokes only a mild immune response, does not cause the development of simian AIDS, and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.In contrast, when these strains infect species that have not adapted to SIV (\"heterologous\" or similar hosts such as rhesus or cynomologus macaques), the animals develop AIDS and the virus generates genetic diversity similar to what is seen in human HIV infection. Chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz), the closest genetic relative of HIV-1, is associated with increased mortality and AIDS-like symptoms in its natural host. SIVcpz appears to have been transmitted relatively recently to chimpanzee and human populations, so their hosts have not yet adapted to the virus. This virus has also lost a function of the nef gene that is present in most SIVs. For non-pathogenic SIV variants, nef suppresses T cell activation through the CD3 marker. Nef's function in non-pathogenic forms of SIV is to downregulate expression of inflammatory cytokines, MHC-1, and signals that affect T cell trafficking. In HIV-1 and SIVcpz, nef does not inhibit T-cell activation and it has lost this function. Without this function, T cell depletion is more likely, leading to immunodeficiency.Three groups of HIV-1 have been identified on the basis of differences in the envelope (env) region: M, N, and O. Group M is the most prevalent and is subdivided into eight subtypes (or clades), based on the whole genome, which are geographically distinct. The most prevalent are subtypes B (found mainly in North America and Europe), A and D (found mainly in Africa), and C (found mainly in Africa and Asia); these subtypes form branches in the phylogenetic tree representing the lineage of the M group of HIV-1. Co-infection with distinct subtypes gives rise to circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). In 2000, the last year in which an analysis of global subtype prevalence was made, 47.2% of infections worldwide were of subtype C, 26.7% were of subtype A/CRF02_AG, 12.3% were of subtype B, 5.3% were of subtype D, 3.2% were of CRF_AE, and the remaining 5.3% were composed of other subtypes and CRFs. Most HIV-1 research is focused on subtype B; few laboratories focus on the other subtypes. The existence of a fourth group, \"P\", has been hypothesised based on a virus isolated in 2009. The strain is apparently derived from gorilla SIV (SIVgor), first isolated from western lowland gorillas in 2006.HIV-2's closest relative is SIVsm, a strain of SIV found in sooty mangabees. Since HIV-1 is derived from SIVcpz, and HIV-2 from SIVsm, the genetic sequence of HIV-2 is only partially homologous to HIV-1 and more closely resembles that of SIVsm.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\nMany HIV-positive people are unaware that they are infected with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.HIV-1 testing is initially done using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a non-reactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative, unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or PCR or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.\n\nAlthough IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.\nModern HIV testing is extremely accurate, when the window period is taken into consideration. A single screening test is correct more than 99% of the time. The chance of a false-positive result in a standard two-step testing protocol is estimated to be about 1 in 250,000 in a low risk population. Testing post-exposure is recommended immediately and then at six weeks, three months, and six months.The latest recommendations of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that HIV testing must start with an immunoassay combination test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and p24 antigen. A negative result rules out HIV exposure, while a positive one must be followed by an HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay to detect which antibodies are present. This gives rise to four possible scenarios:\n\n1. HIV-1 (+) & HIV-2 (\u2212): HIV-1 antibodies detected\n2. HIV-1 (\u2212) & HIV-2 (+): HIV-2 antibodies detected\n3. HIV-1 (+) & HIV-2 (+): both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies detected\n4. HIV-1 (\u2212) or indeterminate & HIV-2 (\u2212): Nucleic acid test must be carried out to detect the acute infection of HIV-1 or its absence.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHIV/AIDS research includes all medical research that attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.\nMany governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions, such as research into sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and anti-retroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, circumcision and HIV, and accelerated aging effects.\n\n\n== Treatment and transmission ==\n\nThe management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs. In many parts of the world, HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare.\nHIV latency, and the consequent viral reservoir in CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, as well as macrophages, is the main barrier to eradication of the virus.It is important to note that although HIV is highly virulent, transmission does not occur through sex when an HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) due to anti-retroviral treatment. This was first argued by the Swiss Federal Commission for AIDS/HIV in 2008 in the Swiss Statement, though the statement was controversial at the time. However, following multiple studies, it became clear that the chance of passing on HIV through sex is effectively zero where the HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load; this is known as U=U, \"Undetectable=Untransmittable\", also phrased as \"can't pass it on\". The studies demonstrating U=U are: Opposites Attract, PARTNER 1, PARTNER 2, (for male-male couples) and HPTN052 (for heterosexual couples) when \"the partner living with HIV had a durably suppressed viral load.\" In these studies, couples where one partner was HIV positive and one partner was HIV negative were enrolled and regular HIV testing completed. In total from the four studies, 4097 couples were enrolled over four continents and 151,880 acts of condomless sex were reported; there were zero phylogenetically linked transmissions of HIV where the positive partner had an undetectable viral load. Following this, the U=U consensus statement advocating the use of \"zero risk\" was signed by hundreds of individuals and organisations, including the US CDC, British HIV Association and The Lancet medical journal. The importance of the final results of the PARTNER 2 study were described by the medical director of the Terrence Higgins Trust as \"impossible to overstate\", while lead author Alison Rodger declared that the message that \"undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable ... can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission.  The authors summarised their findings in The Lancet as follows:\nOur results provide a similar level of evidence on viral suppression and HIV transmission risk for gay men to that previously generated for heterosexual couples and suggest that the risk of HIV transmission in gay couples through condomless sex when HIV viral load is suppressed is effectively zero. Our findings support the message of the U=U (undetectable equals untransmittable) campaign, and the benefits of early testing and treatment for HIV.\nThis result is consistent with the conclusion presented by Anthony S. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and his team in a viewpoint published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, that U=U is an effective HIV prevention method when an undetectable viral load is maintained.Genital herpes (HSV-2) reactivation in those infected with the virus have an associated increase in CCR-5 enriched CD4+ T cells as well as inflammatory dendritic cells in the submucosa of the genital skin. Tropism of HIV for CCR-5 positive cells explains the two to threefold increase in HIV acquisition among persons with genital herpes. Daily antiviral (e.g. acyclovir) medication do not reduce the sub-clinical post reactivation inflammation and therefore does not confer reduced risk of HIV acquisition.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\n\nThe first news story on \"an exotic new disease\" appeared May 18, 1981 in the gay newspaper New York Native.AIDS was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were a cluster of injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP or PJP, the latter term recognizing that the causative agent is now called Pneumocystis jirovecii), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, researchers at the NYU School of Medicine studied gay men developing a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PJP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS is believed to have been in Norway beginning in 1966.In the beginning, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease, often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it, for example, lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus. They also used Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981. In the general press, the term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had been coined. The CDC, in search of a name and looking at the infected communities, coined \"the 4H disease\", as it seemed to single out homosexuals, heroin users, hemophiliacs, and Haitians. However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community, it was realized that the term GRID was misleading and AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982. By September 1982 the CDC started using the name AIDS.In 1983, two separate research groups led by American Robert Gallo and French investigators Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier independently declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting AIDS patients, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal Science. Gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in shape to other human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo admitted in 1987 that the virus he claimed to have discovered in 1984 was in reality a virus sent to him from France the year before. Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a patient presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two classic symptoms of primary HIV infection. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986 LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.Another group working contemporaneously with the Montagnier and Gallo groups was that of Dr. Jay A. Levy at the University of California, San Francisco. He independently discovered the AIDS virus in 1983 and named it the AIDS associated retrovirus (ARV). This virus was very different from the virus reported by the Montagnier and Gallo groups. The ARV strains indicated, for the first time, the heterogeneity of HIV isolates and several of these remain classic examples of the AIDS virus found in the United States.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nBoth HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa, and are believed to have transferred to humans (a process known as zoonosis) in the early 20th century.HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIVcpz, a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIVsmm, a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in littoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.HIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.\n\nThere is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV. Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.\nSpecific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including different patterns of sexual contact (especially multiple, concurrent partnerships), the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased manyfold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable for their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville (currently Kinshasa) were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.The earliest, well-documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Belgian Congo. The virus may have been present in the United States as early as the mid- to late 1960s, as a sixteen-year-old male named Robert Rayford presented with symptoms in 1966 and died in 1969.An alternative and likely complementary hypothesis points to the widespread use of unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single-use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns. Research on the timing of most recent common ancestor for HIV-1 groups M and O, as well as on HIV-2 groups A and B, indicates that SIV has given rise to transmissible HIV lineages throughout the twentieth century. The dispersed timing of these transmissions to humans implies that no single external factor is needed to explain the cross-species transmission of HIV. This observation is consistent with both of the two prevailing views of the origin of the HIV epidemics, namely SIV transmission to humans during the slaughter or butchering of infected primates, and the colonial expansion of sub-Saharan African cities.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAntiviral drug\nDiscovery and development of HIV-protease inhibitors\nHIV/AIDS denialism\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHIV/AIDS at Curlie",

                "summary": "The management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs in an attempt to control HIV infection. There are several classes of antiretroviral agents that act on different stages of the HIV life-cycle. The use of multiple drugs that act on different viral targets is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART decreases the patient's total burden of HIV, maintains function of the immune system, and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death. HAART also prevents the transmission of HIV between serodiscordant same sex and opposite sex partners so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load.Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world, HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare. Anthony Fauci, head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has written, \"With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach.\" In the same paper, he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by antiretroviral therapy. As another commentary in The Lancet noted, \"Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications, clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades.\"The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend offering antiretroviral treatment to all patients with HIV. Because of the complexity of selecting and following a regimen, the potential for side effects, and the importance of taking medications regularly to prevent viral resistance, such organizations emphasize the importance of involving patients in therapy choices and recommend analyzing the risks and the potential benefits.The WHO has defined health as more than the absence of disease. For this reason, many researchers have dedicated their work to better understanding the effects of HIV-related stigma, the barriers it creates for treatment interventions, and the ways in which those barriers can be circumvented.",

There are several classes of antiretroviral agents that act on different stages of the HIV life-cycle. The use of multiple drugs that act on different viral targets is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART decreases the patient's total burden of HIV, maintains function of the immune system, and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death. HAART also prevents the transmission of HIV between serodiscordant same sex and opposite sex partners so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load.Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world, HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare. Anthony Fauci, head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has written, \"With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach.\" In the same paper, he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by antiretroviral therapy. As another commentary in The Lancet noted, \"Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications, clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades.\"The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend offering antiretroviral treatment to all patients with HIV. Because of the complexity of selecting and following a regimen, the potential for side effects, and the importance of taking medications regularly to prevent viral resistance, such organizations emphasize the importance of involving patients in therapy choices and recommend analyzing the risks and the potential benefits.The WHO has defined health as more than the absence of disease. For this reason, many researchers have dedicated their work to better understanding the effects of HIV-related stigma, the barriers it creates for treatment interventions, and the ways in which those barriers can be circumvented.\n\n\n== Classes of medication ==\n\nThere are six classes of drugs, which are usually used in combination, to treat HIV infection. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are broadly classified by the phase of the retrovirus life-cycle that the drug inhibits. Typical combinations include two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) as a \"backbone\" along with one non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitors (also known as integrase nuclear strand transfer inhibitors or INSTIs) as a \"base.\"\n\n\n=== Entry inhibitors ===\nEntry inhibitors (or fusion inhibitors) interfere with binding, fusion and entry of HIV-1 to the host cell by blocking one of several targets. Maraviroc and enfuvirtide are the two available agents in this class.  Maraviroc works by targeting CCR5, a co-receptor located on human helper T-cells. Caution should be used when administering this drug, however, due to a possible shift in tropism which allows HIV to target an alternative co-receptor such as CXCR4.In rare cases, individuals may have a mutation in the CCR5 delta gene which results in a nonfunctional CCR5 co-receptor and in turn, a means of resistance or slow progression of the disease.  However, as mentioned previously, this can be overcome if an HIV variant that targets CXCR4 becomes dominant.  To prevent fusion of the virus with the host membrane, enfuvirtide can be used.  Enfuvirtide is a peptide drug that must be injected and acts by interacting with the N-terminal heptad repeat of gp41 of HIV to form an inactive hetero six-helix bundle, therefore preventing infection of host cells.\n\n\n=== Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors ===\nNucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTI) are nucleoside and nucleotide analogues which inhibit reverse transcription.  HIV is an RNA virus, so it can not be integrated into the DNA in the nucleus of the human cell unless it is first \"reverse\" transcribed into DNA. Since the conversion of RNA to DNA is not naturally done in the mammalian cell, it is performed by a viral protein, reverse transcriptase, which makes it a selective target for inhibition. NRTIs are chain terminators. Once NRTIs are incorporated into the DNA chain, their lack of a 3' OH group prevents the subsequent incorporation of other nucleosides. Both NRTIs and NtRTIs act as competitive substrate inhibitors.  Examples of NRTIs include zidovudine, abacavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, and of NtRTIs \u2013 tenofovir and adefovir.\n\n\n=== Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors ===\nNon-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) inhibit reverse transcriptase by binding to an allosteric site of the enzyme; NNRTIs act as non-competitive inhibitors of reverse transcriptase.  NNRTIs affect the handling of substrate (nucleotides) by reverse transcriptase by binding near the active site.  NNRTIs can be further classified into 1st generation and 2nd generation NNRTIs. 1st generation NNRTIs include nevirapine and efavirenz. 2nd generation NNRTIs are etravirine and rilpivirine. HIV-2 is naturally resistant to NNRTIs.\n\n\n=== Integrase inhibitors ===\nIntegrase inhibitors (also known as integrase nuclear strand transfer inhibitors or INSTIs) inhibit the viral enzyme integrase, which is responsible for integration of viral DNA into the DNA of the infected cell. There are several integrase inhibitors under clinical trial, and raltegravir became the first to receive FDA approval in October 2007.  Raltegravir has two metal binding groups that compete for substrate with two Mg2+ ions at the metal binding site of integrase. As of early 2014, two other clinically approved integrase inhibitors are elvitegravir and dolutegravir.\n\n\n=== Protease inhibitors ===\nProtease inhibitors block the viral protease enzyme necessary to produce mature virions upon budding from the host membrane.  Particularly, these drugs prevent the cleavage of gag and gag/pol precursor proteins.  Virus particles produced in the presence of protease inhibitors are defective and mostly non-infectious. Examples of HIV protease inhibitors are lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and ritonavir. Darunavir and atazanavir are recommended as first line therapy choices. Maturation inhibitors have a similar effect by binding to gag, but development of two experimental drugs in this class, bevirimat and vivecon, was halted in 2010.  Resistance to some protease inhibitors is high. Second generation drugs have been developed that are effective against otherwise resistant HIV variants.\n\n\n== Combination therapy ==\nThe life cycle of HIV can be as short as about 1.5 days from viral entry into a cell, through replication, assembly, and release of additional viruses, to infection of other cells. HIV lacks proofreading enzymes to correct errors made when it converts its RNA into DNA via reverse transcription. Its short life-cycle and high error rate cause the virus to mutate very rapidly, resulting in a high genetic variability. Most of the mutations either are inferior to the parent virus (often lacking the ability to reproduce at all) or convey no advantage, but some of them have a natural selection superiority to their parent and can enable them to slip past defenses such as the human immune system and antiretroviral drugs. The more active copies of the virus, the greater the possibility that one resistant to antiretroviral drugs will be made.When antiretroviral drugs are used improperly, multi-drug resistant strains can become the dominant genotypes very rapidly. In the era before multiple drug classes were available (pre-1997), the reverse-transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, and lamivudine were used serially or in combination leading to the development of multi-drug resistant mutations.In contrast, antiretroviral combination therapy defends against resistance by creating multiple obstacles to HIV replication. This keeps the number of viral copies low and reduces the possibility of a superior mutation. If a mutation that conveys resistance to one of the drugs arises, the other drugs continue to suppress reproduction of that mutation. With rare exceptions, no individual antiretroviral drug has been demonstrated to suppress an HIV infection for long; these agents must be taken in combinations in order to have a lasting effect. As a result, the standard of care is to use combinations of antiretroviral drugs. Combinations usually consist of three drugs from at least two different classes. This three drug combination is commonly known as a triple cocktail. Combinations of antiretrovirals are subject to positive and negative synergies, which limits the number of useful combinations.Because of HIV's tendency to mutate, when patients who have started an antiretrovial regimen fail to take it regularly, resistance can develop. On the other hand, patients who take their medications regularly can stay on one regimen without developing resistance. This greatly increases life expectancy and leaves more drugs available to the individual should the need arise.\n\nIn recent years, drug companies have worked together to combine these complex regimens into single-pill fixed-dose combinations. More than 20 antiretroviral fixed-dose combinations have been developed. This greatly increases the ease with which they can be taken, which in turn increases the consistency with which medication is taken (adherence), and thus their effectiveness over the long-term.\n\n\n=== Adjunct treatment ===\nAlthough antiretroviral therapy has helped to improve the quality of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The findings of this review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.\n\n\n== Treatment guidelines ==\n\n\n=== Initiation of antiretroviral therapy ===\nAntiretroviral drug treatment guidelines have changed over time. Before 1987, no antiretroviral drugs were available and treatment consisted of treating complications from opportunistic infections and malignancies.  After antiretroviral medications were introduced, most clinicians agreed that HIV positive patients with low CD4 counts should be treated, but no consensus formed as to whether to treat patients with high CD4 counts.In April 1995, Merck and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases began recruiting patients for a trial examining the effects of a three drug combination of the protease inhibitor indinavir and two nucleoside analogs. illustrating the substantial benefit of combining 2 NRTIs with a new class of antiretrovirals, protease inhibitors, namely indinavir. Later that year David Ho became an advocate of this \"hit hard, hit early\" approach with aggressive treatment with multiple antiretrovirals early in the course of the infection.  Later reviews in the late 90s and early 2000s noted that this approach of \"hit hard, hit early\" ran significant risks of increasing side effects and development of multidrug resistance, and this approach was largely abandoned. The only consensus was on treating patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 counts less than 350/\u03bcL). Treatment with antiretrovirals was expensive at the time, ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 a year.The timing of when to start therapy has continued to be a core controversy within the medical community, though recent studies have led to more clarity. The NA-ACCORD study observed patients who started antiretroviral therapy either at a CD4 count of less than 500 versus less than 350 and showed that patients who started ART at lower CD4 counts had a 69% increase in the risk of death. In 2015 the START and TEMPRANO studies both showed that patients lived longer if they started antiretrovirals at the time of their diagnosis, rather than waiting for their CD4 counts to drop to a specified level.\nOther arguments for starting therapy earlier are that people who start therapy later have been shown to have less recovery of their immune systems, and higher CD4 counts are associated with less cancer.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the granting of marketing authorizations for two new antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, rilpivirine (Rekambys) and cabotegravir (Vocabria), to be used together for the treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The two medicines are the first ARVs that come in a long-acting injectable formulation. This means that instead of daily pills, people receive intramuscular injections monthly or every two months.The combination of Rekambys and Vocabria injection is intended for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/ml) with their current ARV treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to certain class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INIs).\n\n\n==== Treatment as prevention ====\nA separate argument for starting antiretroviral therapy that has gained more prominence is its effect on HIV transmission. ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood and genital secretions. This has been shown to lead to dramatically reduced transmission of HIV when one partner with a suppressed viral load (<50 copies/ml) has sex with a partner who is HIV negative. In clinical trial HPTN 052, 1763 serodiscordant heterosexual couples in 9 countries were planned to be followed for at least 10 years, with both groups receiving education on preventing HIV transmission and condoms, but only one group getting ART. The study was stopped early (after 1.7 years) for ethical reasons when it became clear that antiviral treatment provided significant protection. Of the 28 couples where cross-infection had occurred, all but one had taken place in the control group consistent with a 96% reduction in risk of transmission while on ART. The single transmission in the experimental group occurred early after starting ART before viral load was likely to be suppressed. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provides HIV-negative individuals with medication\u2014in conjunction with safer-sex education and regular HIV/STI screenings\u2014in order to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. In 2011, the journal Science gave the Breakthrough of the Year award to treatment as prevention.In July 2016 a consensus document was created by the Prevention Access Campaign which has been endorsed by over 400 organisations in 58 countries. The consensus document states that the risk of HIV transmission from a person living with HIV who has been undetectable for a minimum of six months is negligible to non-existent, with negligible being defined as \"so small or unimportant to be not worth considering\". The Chair of the British HIV Association (BHIVA), Chloe Orkin, stated in July 2017 that 'there should be no doubt about the clear and simple message that a person with sustained, undetectable levels of HIV virus in their blood cannot transmit HIV to their sexual partners.'Furthermore, the PARTNER study, which ran from 2010 to 2014, enrolled 1166 serodiscordant couples (where one partner is HIV positive and the other is negative) in a study that found that the estimated rate of transmission through any condomless sex with the HIV-positive partner taking ART with an HIV load less than 200 copies/ml was zero.In summary, as the WHO HIV treatment guidelines state, \"The ARV regimens now available, even in the poorest countries, are safer, simpler, more effective and more affordable than ever before.\"There is a consensus among experts that, once initiated, antiretroviral therapy should never be stopped.  This is because the selection pressure of incomplete suppression of viral replication in the presence of drug therapy causes the more drug sensitive strains to be selectively inhibited.  This allows the drug resistant strains to become dominant.  This in turn makes it harder to treat the infected individual as well as anyone else they infect. One trial showed higher rates of opportunistic infections, cancers, heart attacks and death in patients who periodically interrupted their ART.\n\n\n=== Guideline sources ===\nThere are several treatment guidelines for HIV-1 infected adults in the developed world (that is, those countries with access to all or most therapies and laboratory tests). In the United States there are both the International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) (a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization in the US) as well as the US government's Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. In Europe there are the European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines.For resource limited countries, most national guidelines closely follow the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.\n\n\n==== Guidelines ====\nThe guidelines use new criteria to consider starting HAART, as described below. However, there remain a range of views on this subject and the decision of whether to commence treatment ultimately rests with the patient and his or her doctor.The US DHHS guidelines (published April 8, 2015) state:\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals to reduce the risk of disease progression.\nART also is recommended for HIV-infected individuals for the prevention of transmission of HIV.\nPatients starting ART should be willing and able to commit to treatment and understand the benefits and risks of therapy and the importance of adherence. Patients may choose to postpone therapy, and providers, on a case-by-case basis, may elect to defer therapy on the basis of clinical and/or psychosocial factors.The newest WHO guidelines (dated September 30, 2015) now agree and state:\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated in everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count\n\n\n==== Baseline resistance ====\nBaseline resistance is the presence of resistance mutations in patients who have never been treated before for HIV. In countries with a high rate of baseline resistance, resistance testing is recommended before starting treatment; or, if the initiation of treatment is urgent, then a \"best guess\" treatment regimen should be started, which is then modified on the basis of resistance testing.  In the UK, there is 11.8% medium to high-level resistance at baseline to the combination of efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, and 6.4% medium to high level resistance to stavudine + lamivudine + nevirapine. In the US, 10.8% of one cohort of patients who had never been on ART before had at least one resistance mutation in 2005. Various surveys in different parts of the world have shown increasing or stable rates of baseline resistance as the era of effective HIV therapy continues. With baseline resistance testing, a combination of antiretrovirals that are likely to be effective can be customized for each patient.\n\n\n=== Regimens ===\nMost HAART regimens consist of three drugs: 2 NRTIs (\"backbone\")+ a PI/NNRTI/INSTI (\"base\"). Initial regimens use \"first-line\" drugs with a high efficacy and low side-effect profile.\nThe US DHHS preferred initial regimens for adults and adolescents in the United States, as of April 2015, are:\ntenofovir/emtricitabine and raltegravir (an integrase inhibitor)\ntenofovir/emtricitabine and dolutegravir (an integrase inhibitor)\nabacavir/lamivudine (two NRTIs) and dolutegravir for patients who have been tested negative for the HLA-B*5701 gene allele\ntenofovir/emtricitabine, elvitegravir (an integrase inhibitor) and cobicistat (inhibiting metabolism of the former) in patients with good kidney function (gfr > 70)\ntenofovir/emtricitabine, ritonavir, and darunavir (both latter are protease inhibitors)Both efavirenz and nevirapine showed similar benefits when combined with NRTI respectively.In the case of the protease inhibitor based regimens, ritonavir is used at low doses to inhibit cytochrome p450 enzymes and \"boost\" the levels of other protease inhibitors, rather than for its direct antiviral effect. This boosting effect allows them to be taken less frequently throughout the day. Cobicistat is used with elvitegravir for a similar effect but does not have any direct antiviral effect itself.The WHO preferred initial regimen for adults and adolescents as of June 30, 2013 is:\ntenofovir + lamivudine (or emtricitabine) + efavirenz\n\n\n=== Special populations ===\n\n\n==== Acute infection ====\nIn the first six months after infection HIV viral loads tend to be elevated and people are more often symptomatic than in later latent phases of HIV disease. There may be special benefits to starting antiretroviral therapy early during this acute phase, including lowering the viral \"set-point\" or baseline viral load, reduce the mutation rate of the virus, and reduce the size of the viral reservoir (See section below on viral reservoirs). The SPARTAC trial compared 48 weeks of ART vs 12 weeks vs no treatment in acute HIV infection and found that 48 weeks of treatment delayed the time to decline in CD4 count below 350 cells per ml by 65 weeks and kept viral loads significantly lower even after treatment was stopped.Since viral loads are usually very high during acute infection, this period carries an estimated 26 times higher risk of transmission. By treating acutely infected patients, it is presumed that it could have a significant impact on decreasing overall HIV transmission rates since lower viral loads are associated with lower risk of transmission (See section on treatment as prevention). However an overall benefit has not been proven and has to be balanced with the risks of HIV treatment. Therapy during acute infection carries a grade BII recommendation from the US DHHS.\n\n\n==== Children ====\nHIV can be especially harmful to infants and children, with one study in Africa showing that 52% of untreated children born with HIV had died by age 2. By five years old, the risk of disease and death from HIV starts to approach that of young adults. The WHO recommends treating all children less than 5 years old, and starting all children older than 5 with stage 3 or 4 disease or CD4 <500 cells/ml. DHHS guidelines are more complicated but recommend starting all children less than 12 months old and children of any age who have symptoms.As for which antiretrovirals to use, this is complicated by the fact that many children who are born to mothers with HIV are given a single dose of nevirapine (an NNRTI) at the time of birth to prevent transmission. If this fails it can lead to NNRTI resistance. Also, a large study in Africa and India found that a PI based regimen was superior to an NNRTI based regimen in children less than 3 years who had never been exposed to NNRTIs in the past. Thus the WHO recommends PI based regimens for children less than 3.\nThe WHO recommends for children less than 3 years:\nabacavir (or zidovudine) + lamivudine + lopinivir + ritonivirand for children 3 years to less than 10 years and adolescents <35 kilograms:\n\nabacavir + lamivudine + efavirenzUS DHHS guidelines are similar but include PI based options for children > 3 years old.A systematic review assessed the effects and safety of abacavir-containing regimens as first-line therapy for children between 1 month and 18 years of age when compared to regimens with other NRTIs. This review included two trials and two observational studies with almost eleven thousand HIV infected children and adolescents. They measured virologic suppression, death and adverse events. The authors found that there is no meaningful difference between abacavir-containing regimens and other NRTI-containing regimens. The evidence is of low to moderate quality and therefore it is likely that future research may change these findings.\n\n\n==== Pregnant women ====\n\nThe goals of treatment for pregnant women include the same benefits to the mother as in other infected adults as well as prevention of transmission to her child. The risk of transmission from mother to child is proportional to the plasma viral load of the mother. Untreated mothers with a viral load >100,000 copies/ml have a transmission risk of over 50%. The risk when viral loads are < 1000 copies/ml are less than 1%. ART for mothers both before and during delivery and to mothers and infants after delivery are recommended to substantially reduce the risk of transmission. The mode of delivery is also important, with a planned Caesarian section having a lower risk than vaginal delivery or emergency Caesarian section.HIV can also be detected in breast milk of infected mothers and transmitted through breast feeding. The WHO balances the low risk of transmission through breast feeding from women who are on ART with the benefits of breastfeeding against diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. It also strongly recommends that breastfeeding infants receive prophylactic ART. In the US, the DHHS recommends against women with HIV breastfeeding.\n\n\n==== Older adults ====\nWith improvements in HIV therapy, several studies now estimate that patients on treatment in high-income countries can expect a normal life expectancy. This means that a higher proportion of people living with HIV are now older and research is ongoing into the unique aspects of HIV infection in the older adult. There is data that older people with HIV have a blunted CD4 response to therapy but are more likely to achieve undetectable viral levels. However, not all studies have seen a difference in response to therapy. The guidelines do not have separate treatment recommendations for older adults, but it is important to take into account that older patients are more likely to be on multiple non-HIV medications and consider drug interactions with any potential HIV medications. There are also increased rates of HIV associated non-AIDS conditions (HANA) such as heart disease, liver disease and dementia that are multifactorial complications from HIV, associated behaviors, coinfections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human papilloma virus (HPV) as well as HIV treatment.\n\n\n==== Adults with depression ====\nMany factors may contribute to depression in adults living with HIV, such as the effects of the virus on the brain, other infections or tumours, antiretroviral drugs and other medical treatment. Rates of major depression are higher in people living with HIV compared to the general population, and this may negatively influence antiretroviral treatment. In a systematic review, Cochrane researchers assessed whether giving antidepressants to adults living with both HIV and depression may improve depression. Ten trials, of which eight were done in high-income countries, with 709 participants were included. Results indicated that antidepressants may be better in improving depression compared to placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low and future research is likely to impact on the findings.\n\n\n== Concerns ==\nThere are several concerns about antiretroviral regimens that should be addressed before initiating:\n\nIntolerance: The drugs can have serious side-effects which can lead to harm as well as keep patients from taking their medications regularly.\nResistance: Not taking medication consistently can lead to low blood levels that foster drug resistance.\nCost: The WHO maintains a database of world ART costs which have dropped dramatically in recent years as more first line drugs have gone off-patent. A one pill, once a day combination therapy has been introduced in South Africa for as little as $10 per patient per month. One 2013 study estimated an overall cost savings to ART therapy in South Africa given reduced transmission. In the United States, new on-patent regimens can cost up to $28,500 per patient, per year.\nPublic health: Individuals who fail to use antiretrovirals as directed can develop multi-drug resistant strains which can be passed onto others.\n\n\n== Response to therapy ==\n\n\n=== Virologic response ===\nSuppressing the viral load to undetectable levels (<50 copies per ml) is the primary goal of ART. This should happen by 24 weeks after starting combination therapy. Viral load monitoring is the most important predictor of response to treatment with ART. Lack of viral load suppression on ART is termed virologic failure. Levels higher than 200 copies per ml is considered virologic failure, and should prompt further testing for potential viral resistance.Research has shown that people with an undetectable viral load are unable to transmit the virus through condomless sex with a partner of either gender.  The 'Swiss Statement' of 2008 described the chance of transmission as 'very low' or 'negligible,' but multiple studies have since shown that this mode of sexual transmission is impossible where the HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load.  This discovery has led to the formation of the Prevention Access Campaign are their 'U=U' or 'Undetectable=Untransmittable' public information strategy, an approach that has gained widespread support amongst HIV/AIDS-related medical, charitable, and research organisations. The studies demonstrating that U=U is an effective strategy for preventing HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples so long as \"the partner living with HIV [has] a durably suppressed viral load\" include: Opposites Attract, PARTNER 1, PARTNER 2, (for male-male couples) and HPTN052 (for heterosexual couples). In these studies, couples where one partner was HIV-positive and one partner was HIV-negative were enrolled and regular HIV testing completed. In total from the four studies, 4097 couples were enrolled over four continents and 151,880 acts of condomless sex were reported, there were zero phylogenetically linked transmissions of HIV where the positive partner had an undetectable viral load. Following this the U=U consensus statement advocating the use of 'zero risk' was signed by hundreds of individuals and organisations including the US CDC, British HIV Association and The Lancet medical journal. The importance of the final results of the PARTNER 2 study were described by the medical director of the Terrence Higgins Trust as \"impossible to overstate,\" while lead author Alison Rodger declared that the message that \"undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable ... can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission.\"  The authors summarised their findings in The Lancet as follows:\nOur results provide a similar level of evidence on viral suppression and HIV transmission risk for gay men to that previously generated for heterosexual couples and suggest that the risk of HIV transmission in gay couples through condomless sex when HIV viral load is suppressed is effectively zero. Our findings support the message of the U=U (undetectable equals untransmittable) campaign, and the benefits of early testing and treatment for HIV.\nThis result is consistent with the conclusion presented by Anthony S. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and his team in a viewpoint published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, that U=U is an effective HIV prevention method when an undetectable viral load is maintained.\n\n\n=== Immunologic response ===\nCD4 cell counts are another key measure of immune status and ART effectiveness. CD4 counts should rise 50 to 100 cells per ml in the first year of therapy. There can be substantial fluctuation in CD4 counts of up to 25% based on the time of day or concomitant infections. In one long-term study, the majority of increase in CD4 cell counts was in the first two years after starting ART with little increase afterwards. This study also found that patients who began ART at lower CD4 counts continued to have lower CD4 counts than those who started at higher CD4 counts. When viral suppression on ART is achieved but without a corresponding increase in CD4 counts it can be termed immunologic nonresponse or immunologic failure. While this is predictive of worse outcomes, there is no consensus on how to adjust therapy to immunologic failure and whether switching therapy is beneficial. DHHS guidelines do not recommend switching an otherwise suppressive regimen.Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are another class of immune cell that is depleted during HIV infection. However, if ART is initiated before this depletion at around 7 days post infection, ILC levels can be maintained. While CD4 cell counts typically replenish after effective ART,  ILCs depletion is irreversible with ART initiated after the depletion despite suppression of viremia. Since one of the roles of ILCs is to regulate the immune response to commensal bacteria and to maintain an effective gut barrier, it has been hypothesized that the irreversible depletion of ILCs plays a role in the weakened gut barrier of HIV patients, even after successful ART.\n\n\n== Salvage therapy ==\nIn patients who have persistently detectable viral loads while taking ART, tests can be done to investigate whether there is drug resistance. Most commonly a genotype is sequenced which can be compared with databases of other HIV viral genotypes and resistance profiles to predict response to therapy. Resistance testing may improve virological outcomes in those who have treatment failures. However, there is lack of evidence of effectiveness of such testing in those who have not done any treatment before.If there is extensive resistance a phenotypic test of a patient's virus against a range of drug concentrations can be performed, but is expensive and can take several weeks, so genotypes are generally preferred. Using information from a genotype or phenotype, a regimen of 3 drugs from at least 2 classes is constructed that will have the highest probability of suppressing the virus. If a regimen cannot be constructed from recommended first line agents it is termed salvage therapy, and when 6 or more drugs are needed it is termed mega-HAART.\n\n\n== Structured treatment interruptions ==\nDrug holidays (or \"structured treatment interruptions\") are intentional discontinuations of antiretroviral drug treatment. As mentioned above, randomized controlled studies of structured treatment interruptions have shown higher rates of opportunistic infections, cancers, heart attacks and death in patients who took drug holidays. With the exception of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), treatment guidelines do not call for the interruption of drug therapy once it has been initiated.\n\n\n== Adverse effects ==\nEach class and individual antiretroviral carries unique risks of adverse side effects.\n\n\n=== NRTIs ===\nThe NRTIs can interfere with mitochondrial DNA synthesis and lead to high levels of lactate and lactic acidosis, liver steatosis, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy and lipoatrophy. First-line NRTIs such as lamivudine/emtrictabine, tenofovir, and abacavir are less likely to cause mitochondrial dysfunction.Mitochondrial Haplogroups(mtDNA), non pathologic mutations inherited from the maternal line, have been linked to the efficacy of CD4+ count following ART. Idiosyncratic toxicity with mtDNA haplogroup is also well studied.(Boeisteril et al., 2007).\n\n\n=== NNRTIs ===\nNNRTIs are generally safe and well tolerated. The main reason for discontinuation of efavirenz is neuro-psychiatric effects including suicidal ideation. Nevirapine can cause severe hepatotoxicity, especially in women with high CD4 counts.\n\n\n=== Protease inhibitors ===\nProtease inhibitors (PIs) are often given with ritonavir, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes, leading to numerous drug-drug interactions. They are also associated with lipodystrophy, elevated triglycerides and elevated risk of heart attack.\n\n\n=== Integrase inhibitors ===\nIntegrase inhibitors (INSTIs) are among the best tolerated of the antiretrovirals with excellent short and medium term outcomes. Given their relatively new development there is less long term safety data. They are associated with an increase in creatinine kinase levels and rarely myopathy.\n\n\n== Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) ==\n\nWhen people are exposed to HIV-positive infectious bodily fluids either through skin puncture, contact with mucous membranes or contact with damaged skin, they are at risk for acquiring HIV. Pooled estimates give a risk of transmission with puncture exposures of 0.3% and mucous membrane exposures 0.63%. United States guidelines state that \"feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus are not considered potentially infectious unless they are visibly bloody.\" Given the rare nature of these events, rigorous study of the protective abilities of antiretrovirals are limited but do suggest that taking antiretrovirals afterwards can prevent transmission. It is unknown if three medications are better than two. The sooner after exposure that ART is started the better, but after what period they become ineffective is unknown, with the US Public Health Service Guidelines recommending starting prophylaxis up to a week after exposure. They also recommend treating for a duration of four weeks based on animal studies. Their recommended regimen is emtricitabine + tenofovir + raltegravir (an INSTI). The rationale for this regimen is that it is \"tolerable, potent, and conveniently administered, and it has been associated with minimal drug interactions.\" People who are exposed to HIV should have follow up HIV testing at six, 12, and 24 weeks.\n\n\n== Pregnancy planning ==\n\nWomen with HIV have been shown to have decreased fertility which can affect available reproductive options. In cases where the woman is HIV negative and the man is HIV positive, the primary assisted reproductive method used to prevent HIV transmission is sperm washing followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Preferably this is done after the man has achieved an undetectable plasma viral load. In the past there have been cases of HIV transmission to an HIV-negative partner through processed artificial insemination, but a large modern series in which followed 741 couples where the man had a stable viral load and semen samples were tested for HIV-1, there were no cases of HIV transmission.For cases where the woman is HIV positive and the man is HIV negative, the usual method is artificial insemination. With appropriate treatment the risk of mother-to-child infection can be reduced to below 1%.\n\n\n== History ==\nSeveral buyers clubs sprang up since 1986 to combat HIV. The drug zidovudine (AZT), a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), was not effective on its own. It was approved by the US FDA in 1987. The FDA bypassed stages of its review for safety and effectiveness in order to distribute this drug earlier. Subsequently, several more NRTIs were developed but even in combination were unable to suppress the virus for long periods of time and patients still inevitably died. To distinguish from this early antiretroviral therapy (ART), the term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced. In 1996 two sequential publications in The New England Journal of Medicine by Hammer and colleagues and Gulick and colleagues illustrated the substantial benefit of combining 2 NRTIs with a new class of antiretrovirals, protease inhibitors, namely indinavir. This concept of 3-drug therapy was quickly incorporated into clinical practice and rapidly showed impressive benefit with a 60% to 80% decline in rates of AIDS, death, and hospitalization.As HAART became widespread, fixed dose combinations were made available to ease the administration. Later, the term combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) gained favor with some physicians as a more accurate name, not conveying to patients any misguided idea of the nature of the therapy. Today multidrug, highly effective regimens are long since the default in ART, which is why they are increasingly called simply ART instead of HAART or cART. This retronymic process is linguistically comparable to the way that the words electronic computer and digital computer at first were needed to make useful distinctions in computing technology, but with the later irrelevance of the distinction, computer alone now covers their meaning. Thus as \"all computers are digital now\", so \"all ART is combination ART now.\" However, the names HAART and cART, reinforced by thousands of earlier mentions in medical literature still being regularly cited, also remain in use.\n\n\n== Research ==\nPeople living with HIV can expect to live a nearly normal life span if able to achieve durable viral suppression on combination antiretroviral therapy. However this requires lifelong medication and will still have higher rates of cardiovascular, kidney, liver and neurologic disease. This has prompted further research towards a cure for HIV.\n\n\n=== Patients cured of HIV infection ===\nThe so-called \"Berlin patient\" has been potentially cured of HIV infection and has been off of treatment since 2006 with no detectable virus. This was achieved through two bone marrow transplants that replaced his immune system with a donor's that did not have the CCR5 cell surface receptor, which is needed for some variants of HIV to enter a cell. Bone marrow transplants carry their own significant risks including potential death and was only attempted because it was necessary to treat a blood cancer he had. Attempts to replicate this have not been successful and given the risks, expense and rarity of CCR5 negative donors, bone marrow transplant is not seen as a mainstream option. It has inspired research into other methods to try to block CCR5 expression through gene therapy. A procedure zinc-finger nuclease-based gene knockout has been used in a Phase I trial of 12 humans and led to an increase in CD4 count and decrease in their viral load while off antiretroviral treatment. Attempt to reproduce this failed in 2016. Analysis of the failure showed that gene therapy only successfully treats 11-28% of cells, leaving the majority of CD4+ cells capable of being infected. The analysis found that only patients where less than 40% of cells were infected had reduced viral load. The Gene therapy was not effective if the native CD4+ cells remained. This is the main limitation which must be overcome for this treatment to become effective.After the \"Berlin patient\", two additional patients with both HIV infection and cancer were reported to have no traceable HIV virus after successful stem cell transplants. Virologist Annemarie Wensing of the University Medical Center Utrecht announced this development during her presentation at the 2016 \"Towards an HIV Cure\" symposium.  However, these two patients are still on antiretroviral therapy, which is not the case for the Berlin patient. Therefore, it is not known whether or not the two patients are cured of HIV infection. The cure might be confirmed if the therapy were to be stopped and no viral rebound occurred.In March 2019, a second patient, referred to as the \"London Patient\", was confirmed to be in complete remission of HIV.  Like the Berlin Patient, the London Patient received a bone marrow transplant from a donor who has the same CCR5 mutation.  He has been off antiviral drugs since September 2017, indicating the Berlin Patient was not a \"one-off\".Alternative approaches aiming to mimic one\u2019s biological immunity to HIV through the absence or mutation of the CCR5 gene is being conducted in current research efforts. The efforts of which are done through the introduction of induced pluripotent stem cells that have been CCR5 disrupted through the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.\n\n\n=== Viral reservoirs ===\nThe main obstacle to complete elimination of HIV infection by conventional antiretroviral therapy is that HIV is able to integrate itself into the DNA of host cells and rest in a latent state, while antiretrovirals only attack actively replicating HIV. The cells in which HIV lies dormant are called the viral reservoir, and one of the main sources is thought to be central memory and transitional memory CD4+ T cells. In 2014 there were reports of the cure of HIV in two infants, presumably due to the fact that treatment was initiated within hours of infection, preventing HIV from establishing a deep reservoir. There is work being done to try to activate reservoir cells into replication so that the virus is forced out of latency and can be attacked by antiretrovirals and the host immune system. Targets include histone deacetylase (HDAC) which represses transcription and if inhibited can lead to increased cell activation. The HDAC inhibitors valproic acid and vorinostat have been used in human trials with only preliminary results so far.\n\n\n=== Immune activation ===\nEven with all latent virus deactivated, it is thought that a vigorous immune response will need to be induced to clear all the remaining infected cells. Strategies include using cytokines to restore CD4+ cell counts as well as therapeutic vaccines to prime immune responses. One such candidate vaccine is Tat Oyi, developed by Biosantech. This vaccine is based on the HIV protein tat. Animal models have shown the generation of neutralizing antibodies and lower levels of HIV viremia.\n\n\n=== Sequential mRNA Vaccine ===\nHIV vaccine development is an active area of research and an important tool for managing the global AIDS epidemic. Research into a vaccine for HIV has been ongoing for decades with no lasting success for preventing infection. The rapid development, though, of mRNA vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic may provide a new path forward.\nLike SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, HIV has a spike protein. In retroviruses like HIV, the spike protein is formed by two proteins expressed by the Env gene. This viral envelope binds to the host cell\u2019s receptor and is what gains the virus entry into the cell. With mRNA vaccines, mRNA or messenger RNA, contains the instructions for how to make the spike protein. The mRNA is put into lipid-based nanoparticles for drug delivery. This was a key breakthrough in optimizing the efficiency and efficacy of in vivo delivery. When the vaccine is injected, the mRNA enters cells and joins up with a ribosome. The ribosome then translates the mRNA instructions into the spike protein. The immune system detects the presence of the spike protein and B cells, a type of white blood cell, begin to develop antibodies. Should the actual virus later enter the system, the external spike protein will be recognized by memory B cells, whose function is to memorize the characteristics of the original antigen. Memory B cells then produce the antibodies, hopefully destroying the virus before it can bind to another cell and repeat the HIV life cycle. \nSARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 have similarities\u2014notably both are RNA viruses\u2014but there are important differences. As a retrovirus, HIV-1 can insert a copy of its RNA genome into the host\u2019s DNA, making total eradication more difficult. The virus is also highly mutable making it a challenge for the adaptive immune system to develop a response. As a chronic infection, HIV-1 and the adaptive immune system undergo reciprocal selective pressures leading to the evolutionary arms race of coevolution.Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies, or bnAbs, have been shown to attach to the Env spike protein envelope regardless of the specific HIV mutations. This bodes well for vaccine development. Complicating matters, though, naive B cells\u2014mature B cells not yet exposed to any antigen and are the progenitors of bnAbs\u2014are rare. Further, the mutation events needed to turn these B cells into bnAbs are also rare. Because of this, there is a growing consensus that an effective HIV vaccine will need to create not only humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, but a T-cell-mediated immunity.mRNA vaccines have advantages over traditional vaccines which may help deal with some of the challenges presented by the HIV virus. The mRNA in the vaccine only codes for the protein spike, not the whole virus, so the possibility of reverse transcription, where the virus copies its genetic material into the host\u2019s genome, is not present. Another advantage when compared to traditional vaccines is the speed of development. mRNA vaccines take months not years, which means a multipart sequential vaccine regime is possible.\n\nAttempts to elicit an immune response that triggers broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with a single vaccine dose have been unsuccessful. A multipart sequential mRNA vaccine regime, however, might guide the immune response in the right direction. The first shot triggers an immune response for the correct naive B cells. Later vaccinations encourage the development of these cells further, eventually turning them into memory b cells, and later into plasma cells, which can secrete the broadly neutralizing antibodies:In essence, the sequential immunization approach represents an attempt to mimic Env evolution that would occur with natural infection\u2026. In contrast to traditional prime/boost strategies, in which the same immunogen is used repeatedly for vaccination, the sequential immunization approach relies on a series of different immunogens with the goal of eventually inducing bnAb(s).A Phase 1 clinical trial by Scripps Research and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative of an mRNA vaccine showed that 97 percent of participants had the desired initial \u201cpriming\u201d immune response of naive b cells. This is a positive result for developing the first shot in a vaccine sequence. Moderna is partnering with Scripps and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative for a follow-up phase 1 clinical trial of an HIV mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1644) starting later in 2021.\n\n\n== Drug advertisements ==\nDirect-to-consumer and other advertisements for HIV drugs in the past were criticized for their use of healthy, glamorous models rather than typical people with HIV/AIDS. Usually, these people will present with debilitating conditions or illnesses as a result of HIV/AIDS. In contrast, by featuring people in unrealistically strenuous activities, such as mountain climbing; this proved to be offensive and insensitive to the suffering of people who are HIV positive. The US FDA reprimanded multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers for publishing such adverts in 2001, as the misleading advertisements harmed consumers by implying unproven benefits and failing to disclose important information about the drugs.\nOverall, some drug companies chose not to present their drugs in a realistic way, which consequently harmed the general public's ideas, suggesting that HIV would not affect you as much as suggested. This led to people not wanting to get tested, for fear of being HIV positive, because at the time (in the 80s and 90s particularly), having contracted HIV was seen as a death sentence, as there was no known cure.\nAn example of such a case is Freddie Mercury, who died in 1991, aged 45, of AIDS-related pneumonia.\n\n\n== Beyond medical management ==\nThe preamble to the World Health Organization's Constitution defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Those living with HIV today are met with other challenges that go beyond the singular goal of lowering their viral load. A 2009 meta-analysis studying the correlates of HIV-stigma found that individuals living with higher stigma burden were more likely to have poorer physical and mental health. Insufficient social support and delayed diagnosis due to decreased frequency of HIV testing and knowledge of risk reduction were cited as some of the reasons. People living with HIV (PLHIV) have lower health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores than do the general population. The stigma of having HIV is often compounded with the stigma of identifying with the LGBTQ community or the stigma of being an injecting drug user (IDU) even though heterosexual sexual transmission accounts for 85% of all HIV-1 infections worldwide. AIDS has been cited as the most heavily stigmatized medical condition among infectious diseases. Part of the consequence of this stigma toward PLHIV is the belief that they are seen as responsible for their status and less deserving of treatment.A 2016 study sharing the WHO's definition of health critiques its 90-90-90 target goal, which is part of a larger strategy that aims to eliminate the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030, by arguing that it does not go far enough in ensuring the holistic health of PLHIV. The study suggests that maintenance of HIV and AIDS should go beyond the suppression of viral load and the prevention of opportunistic infection. It proposes adding a 'fourth 90' addressing a new 'quality of life' target that would focus specifically on increasing the quality of life for those that are able to suppress their viral load to undetectable levels along with new metrics to track the progress toward that target. This study serves as an example of the shifting paradigm in the dynamics of the health care system from being heavily 'disease-oriented' to more 'human-centered'. Though questions remain of what exactly a more 'human-centered' method of treatment looks like in practice, it generally aims to ask what kind of support, other than medical support, PLHIV need to cope with and eliminate HIV-related stigmas. Campaigns and marketing aimed at educating the general public in order to reduce any misplaced fears of HIV contraction is one example. Also encouraged is the capacity-building and guided development of PLHIV into more leadership roles with the goal of having a greater representation of this population in decision making positions. Structural legal intervention has also been proposed, specifically referring to legal interventions to put in place protections against discrimination and improve access to employment opportunities. On the side of the practitioner, greater competence for the experience of people living with HIV is encouraged alongside the promotion of an environment of nonjudgment and confidentiality.Psychosocial group interventions such as psychotherapy, relaxation, group support, and education may have some beneficial effects on depression in HIV positive people.\n\n\n== Food insecurity ==\nThe successful treatment and management of HIV/AIDS is affected by a plethora of factors which ranges from successfully taking prescribed medications, preventing opportunistic infection, and food access etc. Food insecurity is a condition in which households lack access to adequate food because of limited money or other resources. Food insecurity is a global issue that have affect billions of people yearly including those living in developed countries.\nFood insecurity is a major public health disparity in the United States of America, which significantly affects minority groups, people living at or below the poverty line, and those who are living with one or more morbidity. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 126,742 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in NYC, of whom 87.6% can be described as living with some level of poverty and food insecurity as reported by the NYC Department of Health March 31, 2019. Having access to a consistent food supply that is safe and healthy is an important part in the treatment and management of HIV/AIDS. PLWHA are also greatly affected by food inequities and food deserts which causes them to be food insecure.  Food insecurity, which can cause malnutrition, can also negatively impact HIV treatment and recovery from opportunistic infections. Similarly, PLWHA require additional calories and nutritionally support that require foods free from contamination to prevent further immunocompromising. Food insecurity can further exacerbate the progression of HIV/AIDS and can prevent PLWHA from consistently following their prescribed regimen, which will lead to poor outcomes.\nIt is imperative that these food insecurity among PLWHA are addressed and rectified to reduce this health inequity. It is important to recognized that socioeconomic status, access to medical care, geographic location, public policy, race and ethnicity all play a pivotal role in the treatment and management of HIV/AIDS. The lack of sufficient and constant income does limit the options for food, treatment, and medications. The same can be inferred for those who are among the oppressed groups in society who are marginalized and may be less inclined or encouraged to seek care and assistance. Endeavors to address food insecurity should be included in HIV treatment programs and may help improve health outcomes if it also focuses on health equity among the diagnosed as much as it focuses on medications. Access to consistently safe and nutritious foods is one of the most important facets in ensuring PLWHA are being provided the best possible care. By altering the narratives for HIV treatment so that more support can be garnered to reduce food insecurity and other health disparities mortality rates will decrease for people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntiviral drug\nAV-HALT\nDiscovery and development of HIV-protease inhibitors\nDiscovery and development of non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors\nDiscovery and development of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors\nHIV capsid inhibition\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHIVinfo \u2013 Comprehensive resource for HIV/AIDS treatment and clinical trial information from the U.

He is the third of eleven children of senator and attorney general Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy (n\u00e9e Skakel). He is a nephew of president and senator John F. Kennedy, and senator Ted Kennedy.\nKennedy grew up at his family's homes in McLean, Virginia, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. He was 9 years old in 1963 when his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated, and 14 years old in 1968 when his father was assassinated while running for president in the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries.\nKennedy learned of his father's shooting when he was at Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boarding school in North Bethesda, Maryland. A few hours later, he flew to Los Angeles on vice-president Hubert Humphrey's plane, along with his elder sister Kathleen and elder brother Joseph, and was with his father when he died. Kennedy was a pallbearer in his father's funeral, where he spoke and read excerpts from his father's speeches at the Mass commemorating his death at Arlington National Cemetery.After obtaining his high school diploma from the Palfrey Street School in Massachusetts, Kennedy continued his education at Harvard and the London School of Economics, graduating from Harvard College in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in American History and Literature. He went on to earn a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia and a Master of Laws from Pace University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1983, when Kennedy was an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan, he was arrested and pled guilty to heroin possession and was sentenced to two years' probation and community service. Following his arrest he entered a drug treatment center and during his probation volunteered for the Natural Resources Defense Council. His probation ended a year early.\nIn 1984, Kennedy joined Riverkeeper as an investigator, and was promoted to senior attorney  when he was admitted to the New York bar in 1985.Kennedy is an environmental law specialist and partner in the law firms of Morgan & Morgan and of Kennedy & Madonna, LLP, and is an advocate for environmental justice.\nThrough litigation, lobbying, teaching, and public campaigns and activism, Kennedy has advocated for the protection of waterways, indigenous rights, and renewable energy.In 2018, the National Trial Lawyers Association awarded Kennedy and his trial team Trial Team of the Year for their work winning a $289 million jury verdict in Dewayne \"Lee\" Johnson v Monsanto.\n\n\n=== Riverkeeper ===\nKennedy litigated and supervised environmental enforcement lawsuits on the east coast estuaries on behalf of Hudson Riverkeeper and the Long Island Soundkeeper, where he was also a board member. Long Island Soundkeeper brought numerous lawsuits against cities and industries along the Connecticut and New York coastlines.  In 1986, Kennedy won a landmark case against Remington Arms Trap and Skeet Gun Club in Stratford, Connecticut, that ended the practice of shooting lead shot into Long Island Sound.  Kennedy also filed federal lawsuits to close the Pelham Bay landfill and the New York Athletic clubs, arguing that those facilities were interfering with public use of Long Island Sound.  On the Hudson, Kennedy brought a series of lawsuits against municipalities, including New York City, to properly treat sewage, and against industries, including Consolidated Edison, General Electric and Exxon, to stop discharging pollution and to clean up legacy contamination.In 1995, Kennedy advocated for repeal of the anti-environmental legislation during the 104th Congress. In 1997, Kennedy worked with John Cronin to write The Riverkeepers, a history of the early Riverkeepers and a primer for the Waterkeeper movement.Drawing on his experience investigating and suing polluters on behalf of the Waterkeepers, Kennedy has written extensively about environmental law enforcement.\n\n\n=== Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic ===\nIn 1987, Kennedy founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic at Pace University School of Law, where for three decades he was the clinic's supervising attorney and co-director, and as Clinical Professor of Law. Kennedy obtained a special order from the New York State Court of Appeals that permitted his 10 clinic students\u2013second- and third-year law students\u2013to practice law and to try cases against Hudson River polluters in state and federal court, under the supervision of Kennedy and his co-director, Professor Karl Coplan. The clinic's full-time clients are Riverkeeper and Long Island Soundkeeper.The clinic has sued numerous governments and companies for polluting Long Island Sound and the Hudson River and its tributaries.  The clinic argued cases to expand citizen access to the shoreline and won hundreds of settlements for the Hudson Riverkeeper.  Kennedy and his students also sued dozens of municipal waste-water treatment plants to force compliance with the Clean Water Act. In 2010, a Pace lawsuit forced ExxonMobil to clean up tens of millions of gallons of oil from legacy refinery spills in Newtown Creek in Brooklyn, New York.On April 11, 2001, Men's Journal recognized Kennedy with its \"Heroes\" Award for his creation of the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic.  Kennedy and his Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic received other awards for successful legal work cleaning up the environment.  The Pace Clinic became a model for similar environmental law clinics throughout the country including Rutgers,  Golden Gate, UCLA,  Widener, and Boalt Hall at Berkeley.\n\n\n=== Waterkeepers Alliance ===\nIn June 1999, as Riverkeeper's success on the Hudson began inspiring the creation of Waterkeepers across North America, Kennedy and a few dozen Riverkeepers gathered in Southampton, Long Island, to found the Waterkeeper Alliance, which is now the umbrella group for the 344 licensed Waterkeeper programs located in 44 countries. As President of the Alliance, Kennedy oversees its legal, membership, policy and fundraising programs. The Alliance states that it is dedicated to promoting \"swimmable, fishable, drinkable waterways, worldwide,\" and is also a clearinghouse, approving new Keeper programs and licensing use of the trademarked \"Waterkeeper,\" \"Riverkeeper,\" \"Soundkeeper,\" \"Lakekeeper,\" \"Baykeeper,\" \"Bayoukeeper,\" \"Canalkeeper,\" \"Coastkeeper,\" etc. names.Kennedy and his environmental work have been the focus of several films including The Hudson Riverkeepers (1998) and The Waterkeepers (2000), both directed by Les Guthman. In 2008, he appeared in the IMAX documentary film Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk, riding the length of the Grand Canyon in a wooden dory with his daughter Kick and with anthropologist Wade Davis.\n\n\n=== New York City Watershed Agreement ===\nBeginning in 1991, Kennedy represented environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers in a series of lawsuits against New York City and upstate watershed polluters. Kennedy authored a series of articles and reports alleging that New York State was abdicating its responsibility to protect the water repository and supply. In 1996, he helped orchestrate the $1.2 billion New York City Watershed Agreement, which New York magazine recognized in its cover story, \"The Kennedy Who Matters\". This agreement, which Kennedy negotiated on behalf of environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers, is regarded as an international model in stakeholder consensus negotiations and sustainable development.\n\n\n=== Kennedy & Madonna LLP ===\n\nIn 2000, Kennedy and environmental lawyer Kevin Madonna founded the environmental law firm Kennedy & Madonna, LLP, to represent private plaintiffs against polluters. The firm litigates environmental contamination cases on behalf of individuals, non-profit organizations, school districts, public water suppliers, Indian tribes, municipalities and states. In 2001, Kennedy & Madonna organized a team of prestigious plaintiff law firms to challenge pollution from industrial pork and poultry production.  In 2004, the firm was part of a legal team that secured a $70 million settlement for property owners in Pensacola, Florida whose properties were contaminated by chemicals from an adjacent Superfund site.Kennedy & Madonna is profiled in the 2010 HBO documentary Mann v. Ford that chronicles four years of litigation brought by the firm on behalf of the Ramapough Mountain Indian Tribe against the Ford Motor Company over the dumping of toxic waste on tribal lands in northern New Jersey.  In addition to a monetary settlement for the tribe, the lawsuit contributed to the community's land being re-listed on the federal Superfund list, the first time in the nation's history that a de-listed site was re-listed.  In 2007 Kennedy was one of three finalists nominated as \"Trial Lawyer of the Year\" by Public Justice for his role in the $396 million jury verdict against DuPont for contamination from its Spelter, West Virginia zinc plant. In 2017, the firm was part of the trial team that secured a $670 million settlement on behalf of over 3,000 residents from Ohio and West Virginia whose drinking water was contaminated with the toxic chemical, C8, which was released into the environment by DuPont in Parkersburg, West Virginia.\n\n\n=== Morgan & Morgan PA ===\nIn 2016, Kennedy became counsel to the Morgan & Morgan P.A. law firm.  The partnership arose from the two firms' successful collaboration on the case against SoCalGas Company following the Aliso Canyon gas leak in California.  In 2017, Kennedy and his partners sued Monsanto in federal court in San Francisco, on behalf of plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, that, the plaintiffs allege, were a result of exposure to Monsanto's glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup. Kennedy and his team also filed a class action lawsuit against Monsanto for failing to warn consumers about the dangers allegedly posed by exposure to Roundup. In September 2018, Kennedy and his partners filed a class-action lawsuit against Columbia Gas of Massachusetts alleging negligence following gas explosions in three towns north of Boston. Of Columbia Gas, Kennedy said \"as they build new miles of pipe, the same company is ignoring its existing infrastructure, which we now know is eroding and is dilapidated.\"\n\n\n=== Cleantech and renewable energy infrastructure entrepreneurship ===\nIn 1998, Kennedy, Chris Bartle and John Hoving created a bottled-water company, Keeper Springs, which donated all of its profits to Waterkeeper Alliance. In 2013, Kennedy and his partner sold the brand to Nestl\u00e9 in exchange for a donation to local Waterkeepers.Kennedy was a venture partner and senior advisor at VantagePoint Capital Partners, one of the world's largest cleantech venture capital firms. Among other activities, VantagePoint was the original and largest pre-IPO institutional investor in Tesla. VantagePoint also backed BrightSource Energy and Solazyme, amongst others. Kennedy is a board member and counselor to several of Vantage Point's portfolio companies in the water and energy space, including Ostara, a Vancouver-based company that markets the technology to remove phosphorus and other excessive nutrients from wastewater, transforming otherwise pollution directly into high-grade fertilizer.  He is also a senior advisor to Starwood Energy Group and has played a key role in a number of the firm's investments.He is on the board of Vionx, a Massachusetts-based utility scale vanadium flow battery systems manufacturer. On October 5, 2017, Vionx, National Grid and the US Department of Energy completed the installation of advanced flow batteries at Holy Name High School in the city of Worcester, Massachusetts. The collaboration also includes Siemens and the United Technologies Research Center and constitutes one of the largest energy storage facilities in Massachusetts.Kennedy is a Partner in ColorZen, which offers a turnkey cotton fiber pre-treatment solution that reduces water usage and toxic discharges in the cotton dyeing process.Kennedy was a co-owner and Director of the smart grid company Utility Integration Solutions (UISol),  which was acquired by Alstom. He is presently a co-owner and Director of GridBright, the market-leading grid management specialist.In October 2011, Kennedy co-founded EcoWatch, an environmental news site. He resigned from the board of directors in January 2018.\n\n\n=== Minority and poor communities ===\nIn his first case as an environmental attorney, Kennedy represented the NAACP in a lawsuit against a proposal to build a garbage transfer station in a minority neighborhood in Ossining, New York.In 1987, he successfully sued Westchester County, New York, to reopen the Croton Point Park, which was heavily used primarily by poor and minority communities from the Bronx. He then forced the reopening of the Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, which New York City had closed to the public and converted to a police firing range.Kennedy has argued that poor communities shoulder the disproportionate burden of environmental pollution. Speaking at the 2016 SXSW Eco environment conference in Austin, Texas, he said, \"Polluters always choose the soft target of poverty\", noting that Chicago's south side has the highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in America. Furthermore, he added that 80 percent of \"uncontrolled toxic waste dumps\" can be found in black neighborhoods, with the largest site in the United States being in Emelle, Alabama, which is 90 percent black.\n\n\n=== International and indigenous rights ===\nStarting in 1985, Kennedy helped develop the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)'s international program for environmental, energy, and human rights, traveling to Canada and Latin America to assist indigenous tribes in protecting their homelands and opposing large-scale energy and extractive projects in remote wilderness areas.In 1990, Kennedy assisted indigenous Pehuenches in Chile in a partially successful campaign to stop the construction of a series of dams on Chile's iconic Biob\u00edo River. That campaign derailed all but one of the proposed dams. Beginning in 1992, he assisted the Cree Indians of northern Quebec in their campaign against Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec to halt construction of some 600 proposed dams on eleven rivers in James Bay.In 1993, Kennedy and NRDC, working with the indigenous rights organization Cultural Survival, clashed with other American environmental groups in a dispute about the rights of Indians to govern their own lands in the Oriente region of Ecuador. Kennedy represented the CONFENIAE, a confederation of Indian peoples, in negotiation with the American oil company Conoco to limit oil development in Ecuadorian Amazon and, at the same time, obtain benefits from resource extraction for Amazonian tribes. Kennedy was a vocal critic of Texaco for its previous record for polluting the Ecuadoran Amazon.From 1993 to 1999, Kennedy worked with five Vancouver Island Indian tribes in their campaign to end industrial logging by MacMillan Bloedel in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia.In 1996, Kennedy met with Cuban President Fidel Castro to persuade the leader to halt his plans to construct a nuclear power plant at Juragu\u00e1. During a lengthy latenight encounter, Castro reminisced about Kennedy's father and uncle, speculating that U.S. relations with Cuba would have been far better had President Kennedy not been assassinated.Between 1996 and 2000, Kennedy and NRDC helped Mexican commercial fishermen to halt Mitsubishi's proposal to build a salt facility in the Laguna San Ignacio, a known area in Baja where gray whales bred, and nursed their calves. Kennedy wrote extensively against the project, and took the campaign to Japan, meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.In 2000, he assisted local environmental activists to stop proposals by Chaffin Light, a real estate developer, and U.S. engineering giant Bechtel from building a large hotel and resort development that, Kennedy argued, threatened coral reefs and public beaches used extensively by local Bahamians, at Clifton Bay, New Providence Island. Following this, the new Bahamian government designated the area a Heritage Park.Kennedy was one of the early editors of Indian Country Today, North America's largest Native American newspaper. He helped lead the opposition to the damming of the Futaleuf\u00fa River in the Patagonia region of Chile. In 2016, citing the pressure precipitated by the Futaleuf\u00fa Riverkeeper's campaign against the dams, the Spanish power company, Endesa, which owned the right to dam the river, reversed its decision and relinquished all claims to the Futaleuf\u00fa.\n\n\n=== Military and Vieques ===\nKennedy has been a critic of environmental damage by the U.S. military. In 1993, he successfully represented the Suquamish and Duwamish Indian tribes in a lawsuit against the U.S. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, to stop polluting Puget Sound.In a 2001 article, Kennedy described how he sued the U.S. Navy on behalf of fishermen and residents of Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico, to stop weapons testing, bombing, and other military exercises. Kennedy argued that the activities were unnecessary, and that the Navy had illegally destroyed several endangered species, polluted the island's waters, harmed the residents' health, and damaged its economy. He was arrested for trespassing at Camp Garcia Vieques, the U.S. Navy training facility, where he and others were protesting the use of a section of the island for training. Kennedy served 30 days in a maximum security prison in Puerto Rico. The trespassing incident forced the suspension of live-fire exercises for almost three hours. The lawsuits and protests by Kennedy, and hundreds of Puerto Ricans who were also imprisoned, eventually forced the termination of naval bombing in Vieques by president George Bush.In a 2003 article for the Chicago Tribune, Kennedy accused the U.S. federal government of being \"America's biggest polluter\" and the U.S. Department of Defense as the worst offender. Citing the EPA, he said that \"unexploded ordnance waste can be found on 16,000 military ranges...and more than half may contain biological or chemical weapons\".\n\n\n=== Factory farms ===\nFor almost twenty years, Kennedy and his Waterkeepers waged a legal and public relations battle against pollution by factory farms. In the 1990s, he rallied opposition to factory farms among small independent farmers, convened a series of \"National Summits\" on factory meat products, and conducted press conference whistle stop tours across North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio and in Washington DC. Beginning in 2000, Kennedy sued factory farms in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Maryland, and Iowa. He wrote numerous articles on the subject, arguing that factory farms produce lower-quality, less healthy food, and are harmful to independent family farmers by poisoning their air and water, reducing their property values, and using extensive state and federal subsidies to impose unfair competition against smaller farmers.In 1995, Premier Ralph Klein of Alberta declared Kennedy persona non grata in the province due to Kennedy's activism against Alberta's large-scale hog production facilities.  In 2002, Smithfield Foods filed a lawsuit against Kennedy in Poland, under a Polish law that makes criticizing a corporation illegal, after Kennedy denounced the company in a debate with Smithfield's Polish director before the Polish parliament.\n\n\n=== Oil, gas, and pipelines ===\nKennedy has been an advocate for a global transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy.  He has been particularly critical of the oil industry. He began his career at Riverkeeper during the time that the organization discovered that Exxon was using its oil tankers in order to steal fresh water from the Hudson River for use in its Aruba refinery and to sell to Caribbean Islands. Riverkeeper won a $2 million settlement against Exxon and lobbied successfully for a state law outlawing the practice. In one of his first environmental cases, Kennedy filed a lawsuit against Mobil Oil for polluting the Hudson.Kennedy helped lead the battle against fracking in New York State.  He had been an early supporter of natural gas as viable bridge fuel to renewables, and a cleaner alternative to coal. However, he said he turned against this controversial extraction method after investigating its cost to public health; climate and road infrastructure. As a member of Governor Andrew Cuomo's fracking commission, Kennedy helped engineer the Governor's 2013 ban on fracking in New York State.Kennedy mounted a national effort against the construction of liquefied natural gas facilities.  Waterkeepers maintains a national watch that documents numerous crude oil spills annually.  In Alaska, Kennedy was active in the fight to save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the largest undisturbed ecosystem in North America, from drilling.In 2013, Kennedy assisted the Chipewyan First Nation and the Beaver Lake Cree fighting to protect their land from tar sands production. In February 2013, while protesting the Keystone XL Pipeline Kennedy, along with his son, Conor, was arrested for blocking a thoroughfare in front of the White House during a protest.  In August 2016, Kennedy and Waterkeeper participated in protests to block the extension of the Dakota Access pipeline across the Sioux Indian Standing Rock Reservation's water supply.Kennedy claims that the only reason the oil industry is able to remain competitive against renewables and electric cars is through massive direct and indirect subsidies and political interventions on behalf of the oil industry. In a June 2017 interview on EnviroNews, Kennedy said about the oil industry, \"That's what their strategy is: build as many miles of pipeline as possible. And what the industry is trying to do is to increase that level of infrastructure investment so our country won't be able to walk away from it.\n\n\n=== Coal ===\nUnder Kennedy's leadership, Waterkeeper launched its \"Clean Coal is a Deadly Lie\" campaign in 2001, bringing dozens of lawsuits targeting mining practices, which include mountaintop removal, slurry pond construction, and targeting mercury emissions and coal ash piles by coal-burning utilities. Kennedy's Waterkeeper alliance has also been leading the fight against coal export, including from terminals in the Pacific Northwest.Kennedy has promoted replacing coal energy with renewable energy, which, he argues, would thereby reduce costs and greenhouse gases while improving air and water quality, the health of the citizens, and the number and quality of jobs.\nIn June 2011, film producer Bill Haney televised his award-winning film The Last Mountain, co-written by Haney and Peter Rhodes, depicting Kennedy's fight to stop Appalachian mountaintop removal mining.\n\n\n=== Nuclear power ===\nKennedy has been an opponent of conventional nuclear power, arguing that it is unsafe and not economically competitive. On June 15, 1981, he made international news when he spoke at an anti-nuclear rally at the Hollywood Bowl, with Stephen Stills, Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne.His thirty-year battle to close Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York ended in victory in January 2017, when Kennedy signed onto an agreement with New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo and Entergy, the plant's operator, to close the plant by 2021. Kennedy was featured in a 2004 documentary, Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable, directed by his sister and documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy.\n\n\n=== Hydro ===\nKennedy has been an outspoken opponent of dams, particularly of dam projects that affect indigenous communities.\nIn 1991, Kennedy helped lead a campaign to block Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec from building the James Bay Hydro-project, a massive dam project in northern Quebec.His campaigns helped block dams on Chile's Biob\u00edo River in 1990 and its Futaleuf\u00fa River in 2016. In 2002, he mounted what was ultimately an unsuccessful battle against building a dam on Belize's Macal River. Kennedy termed the Chalillo Dam \"a boondoggle\", and brought a high-profile legal challenge against Fortis Inc., a Canadian power company and the monopoly owner of Belize's electric utility. In a 3\u20132 ruling in 2003, the Privy Council of the United Kingdom upheld the Belizean government's decision to permit dam construction.In 2004, Kennedy met with Provincial officials and brought foreign media and political visitors to Canada to protest the building of hydroelectric dams on Quebec's Magpie River. Hydro-Quebec dropped plans for the dam in 2017.In November 2017, the Spanish hydroelectric syndicate Endesa decided to abandon HydroAysen, a massive project to construct dams on dozens of Patagonia's rivers accompanied by thousands of miles of roads, power lines and other infrastructure. Endesa returned its water rights to the Chilean government. The Chilean press credits advocacy by Kennedy and Riverkeeper as critical factors in the company's decision.\n\n\n=== Cape Wind ===\nIn 2005, Kennedy clashed with national environmental groups over his opposition to a wind farm off Cape Cod. Taking the side of Cape Cod's commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the Cape Wind Project in Nantucket Sound was a costly boondoggle. This position angered some environmentalists, and brought Kennedy criticism by industry groups and Republicans. Kennedy argued in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal that \"Vermont wants to take its nuclear plant off line and replace it with clean, green power from HydroQu\u00e9bec\u2014power available to Massachusetts utilities\u2014at a cost of six cents per kilowatt hour (kwh). Cape Wind electricity, by a conservative estimate and based on figures they filed with the state, comes in at 25 cents per kwh.\"\n\n\n== Political views ==\n\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nThroughout the presidency of George W. Bush, Kennedy was a persistent critic of Bush's environmental and energy policies. He accused Bush of defunding and corrupting federal science projects.Kennedy was also critical of Bush's 2003 hydrogen car initiative, arguing that it was a gift to the fossil fuel industry disguised as a green automobile.In 2003, Kennedy wrote an article in Rolling Stone about Bush's environmental record, which he subsequently expanded into a New York Times bestselling book. His opposition to the environmental policies of the Bush administration earned him recognition as one of Rolling Stone's \"100 Agents of Change\" on April 2, 2009.During an October 2012 interview with Politico, Kennedy called on environmentalists to direct their dissatisfaction towards the U.S. Congress rather than President Barack Obama, reasoning that Obama \"didn't deliver\" due to having a partisan U.S. Congress \"like we haven't seen before in American history\".  He also accused politicians who failed to act on climate change policy as serving special interests and, selling out the public trust. He accused Charles and David Koch, the owners of Koch Industries, Inc., the nation's largest privately owned oil company, of subverting democracy and for \"making themselves billionaires by impoverishing the rest of us\".  Kennedy has spoken of the Koch Brothers as leading \"the apocalyptical forces of Ignorance and Greed\".During the 2014 People's Climate March, Kennedy said, \"American politics is driven by two forces: One is intensity, and the other is money. The Koch brothers have all the money. They're putting $300 million this year into their efforts to stop the climate bill. And the only thing we have in our power is people power, and that's why we need to put this demonstration on the street\".\n\n\n=== U.S. foreign policy ===\nKennedy has written extensively on foreign policy, beginning with a 1974 Atlantic Monthly article titled, \"Poor Chile\", discussing the overthrow of Chilean President Salvador Allende.  Kennedy also wrote editorials against the execution of Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. In 1975, he published an article in The Wall Street Journal, criticizing the use of assassination as a foreign policy tool.  In 2005, he wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times decrying President Bush's use of torture as anti-American. Senator Edward Kennedy entered the article into the Congressional Record.In an article titled \"Why the Arabs Don't Want Us in Syria\", published in Politico in February 2016, Kennedy referred to the \"bloody history that modern interventionists like George W. Bush, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio miss when they recite their narcissistic trope that Mideast nationalists 'hate us for our freedoms.' For the most part they don't; instead they hate us for the way we betrayed those freedoms \u2014 our own ideals \u2014 within their borders\".  Kennedy blames the Syrian war on a pipeline dispute. He cites apparent WikiLeaks disclosures alleging that the CIA-led military and intelligence planners to foment a Sunni uprising against Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, following his rejection of a proposed Qatar-Turkey pipeline through Syria in 2009, well before the Arab Spring.\n\n\n=== Political endorsements ===\nKennedy was on the National Staff and a State Coordinator for Edward M. Kennedy for President from 1979 to 1980. Prior to that he had been on Senator Kennedy's 1970 and 1976 Massachusetts senatorial campaigns. He was a co-founder and a former board member of the New York League of Conservation Voters.Kennedy endorsed and campaigned extensively for Vice President Al Gore during his 2000 presidential campaign, and openly opposed his friend Ralph Nader's Green Party presidential campaign. In the 2004 presidential election, Kennedy endorsed John Kerry, noting his strong environmental record.\n\nIn late 2007, Kennedy and his sisters Kerry and Kathleen endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. After the Democratic Convention, Kennedy campaigned for Obama across the country. After the election, he was named as a front-runner for Obama's EPA administrator.Kennedy has been critical of the integrity of the voting process. In June 2006, he published an article in Rolling Stone purporting to show that GOP operatives stole the 2004 presidential election for President George W. Bush. Farhad Manjoo countered Kennedy's conclusions, but there were other people who argued otherwise.Kennedy has written frequent warnings about the ease of election hacking and the dangers of voter purges and voter ID laws. He wrote the introduction and a chapter in Billionaires and Ballot Bandits, a 2012 book on election hacking by the investigative journalist Greg Palast.\n\n\n=== Political aspirations ===\nKennedy first considered running for political office in 2000, when New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan did not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by Kennedy's father. His father was elected to the same seat in 1964, and held it for 41 months, until his death in 1968.\nIn 2005, Kennedy considered running for New York Attorney General, which would have meant a possible run against his then brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo, but in the end he decided against entering the race, even though he had been considered the frontrunner.On December 2, 2008, Kennedy stated that he did not wish to be appointed to the U.S. Senate by New York Governor David Paterson. He felt that it would take too much time away from his family.\n\n\n== Personal opinions ==\n\n\n=== Food allergies ===\nKennedy was a founding board member of the Food Allergy Initiative. His son suffers from anaphylactic peanut allergies. Kennedy wrote the foreword to The Peanut Allergy Epidemic, in which he and the authors falsely link increasing food allergies in children to certain vaccines that were approved beginning in 1989.\n\n\n=== Autism and vaccines ===\nKennedy is the chairman of Children's Health Defense (formerly the World Mercury Project), an advocacy group he founded in 2016. The group alleges a large proportion of American children are suffering from conditions as diverse as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases due to exposure to certain chemicals and radiation. The Children's Health Defense has blamed and campaigned against vaccines, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, wireless communications, and others. Kennedy's group has been identified as one of two major buyers of anti-vaccine Facebook advertising in late 2018 and early 2019.In its early years, the group focused on the perceived issue of mercury in industry and medicine, especially the ethylmercury compound thimerosal in vaccines, proposed by the discredited former doctor Andrew Wakefield as a mechanism for the disproved link between vaccines and autism. Critics have said Kennedy and his organization spread common anti-vaccine arguments as part of their core messages.According to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Kennedy leverages his status as a prominent activist for environmental causes to bolster other actors of the anti-vaccination movement, regularly appearing in online conversations with the likes of Wakefield, Del Bigtree, Rashid Buttar. Kennedy has stated the media and governments are engaged in a conspiracy to deny that vaccines cause autism. The Center for Countering Digital Hate in 2021 identified Kennedy as one of 12 people responsible for up to 65% of anti-vaccine content on social media platforms Facebook and Twitter.In June 2005, Kennedy wrote an article in Rolling Stone and Salon called \"Deadly Immunity\", alleging a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. The article contained five factual errors, leading Salon to issue corrections. Six years later Salon retracted the article completely. According to Salon, the retraction was motivated by accumulating evidence of alleged errors and scientific fraud underlying the vaccine-autism claim. A corrected version of the original article can still be found on the Rolling Stone website.In May 2013, Kennedy delivered the keynote address at the anti-vaccination AutismOne / Generation Rescue conference.In 2014, Kennedy's book, Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak: The Evidence Supporting the Immediate Removal of Mercury\u2014a Known Neurotoxin\u2014from Vaccines, was published. While methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin, ethylmercury, as used in vaccine preservatives, is safer.  The preface to the book is written by Mark Hyman, a proponent of the alternative medical treatment called functional medicine. Kennedy has published many articles on the inclusion of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in vaccines.In April 2015, Kennedy participated in a Speakers' Forum to promote the film Trace Amounts, which promotes the link between autism and mercury in vaccinations. At a film screening, Kennedy described the autism epidemic as a \"holocaust\".On January 10, 2017, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump met to discuss a position in the Trump administration. Kennedy accepted an offer made by Trump to become the chairman of the Vaccine Safety Task Force. A spokeswoman for Trump's transition said that no final decision had been made. In an August 2017 interview with STAT News reporter Helen Branswell, Kennedy said that he had been meeting with the federal public health regulators to discuss defects in vaccine safety science, at the White House's request.On February 15, 2017, Kennedy and actor Robert De Niro gave a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in which they accused the press of acting as propagandists for the $35 billion vaccination industry and refusing to allow debates on vaccination science. They offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist or other citizen who could point to a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies and pregnant women at levels currently contained in flu vaccines. Craig Foster, a psychology professor who studies pseudoscience, deemed the challenge \"not science\", observing that it was a \"carefully constructed 'contest' that allows its creators to generate the misleading outcome they presumably want to see\". He also stated that \"Proving that something is safe is importantly different than proving that something is harmful\".On May 8, 2019, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Joseph P. Kennedy and Maeve Kennedy McKean wrote an open letter stating that while their relative has championed many admirable causes, he \"has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines\". On December 30, 2020, Kennedy's niece Kerry Kennedy Meltzer, a physician, wrote a similar open letter. She argued her uncle published misinformation about the side effects of the new COVID-19 vaccines.On June 4, 2019, during a visit to Samoa coinciding with that nation's 57th independence celebration, Kennedy appeared in an Instagram photo with Australian-Samoan anti-vaccine activist Taylor Winterstein. Kennedy's charity and Winterstein have both perpetuated the allegation that the MMR vaccine played a role in the 2018 deaths of two Samoan infants, despite the subsequent revelation that the infants had received a muscle relaxant along with the vaccine by mistake. Kennedy has drawn criticism for fueling vaccine hesitancy amid a social climate which gave rise to the 2019 Samoa measles outbreak, which killed over 70 people, and the 2019 Tonga measles outbreak. On February 11, 2021, his Instagram account was permanently deleted \"for repeatedly sharing debunked claims\" about COVID-19 vaccines.Kennedy is listed as executive producer of Vaxxed II: The People's Truth, the 2019 sequel to Wakefield's and Bigtree's anti-vaccination documentary Vaxxed.Similar to many who share his beliefs, Kennedy has claimed that he is not against vaccines but wishes that they be more thoroughly tested and investigated.In early March 2021, Kennedy's anti-vaccine organization, Children's Health Defense released a new anti-vaccine propaganda video, \"Medical Racism: The New Apartheid\" that promotes COVID-19 conspiracy theories and claims that COVID-19 vaccination efforts are medical experiments on the Black community. Kennedy himself appears in the video, inviting the viewers to disregard information dispensed by health authorities and doctors. Brandi Collin-Dexter, a Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy states \"the notorious figures and false narratives in the documentary were recognizable\" and that \"the film's incompatible narratives sought to take advantage of the pain felt by Black communities\".\n\n\n=== COVID-19 ===\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy promoted multiple conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 including false claims both Anthony Fauci and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are trying to profit off a vaccine, and suggesting that Bill Gates would cut off access to money of people who do not get vaccinated, allowing them to starve. In August 2020, Kennedy appeared in an hour-long interview with Alec Baldwin on Instagram, where he touted a number of incorrect and misleading claims about vaccines and public health measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Baldwin was criticized by public health officials and scientists for allowing Kennedy's proclamations to go unchallenged. Kennedy has promoted misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine, falsely suggesting that it contributed to the death of 86-year-old Hank Aaron and others. In February 2021 his Instagram account was blocked for \"repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.\" The Center for Countering Digital Hate identified Kennedy as one of the main propagators of conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and 5G phone technology. His success as a conspiracy theorist increased his social media impact considerably; between the Spring and the Fall of 2020, his Instagram account grew from 121,000 followers to 454,000.In November 2021, Kennedy's book The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health was published wherein he alleges Fauci sabotaged treatments for AIDS, violated federal laws, and conspired with Bill Gates and social media companies such as Facebook to suppress any information about COVID-19 cures, to leave vaccines as the only options to fight the pandemic.\nIn the book, Kennedy calls Fauci \"a powerful technocrat who orchestrated and executed the historic 2020 coup against Western democracy\". He claims Fauci and Bill Gates plan to prolong the pandemic and exaggerate its effects, promoting expensive vaccinations for the benefit of \"a powerful vaccination cartel\". He also released a video depicting Fauci with a Hitler moustache. The Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung has said of the book \"\u2026polemics alternate with chapters that pedantically seek to substantiate Kennedy's accusations with numerous quotations and studies.\"Kennedy wrote the foreword for Plague of Corruption (2020), a book by former research scientist and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Judy Mikovits.Kennedy appeared as a speaker at the partially violent demonstration in Berlin on August 29, 2020, where populist groups called for an end to restrictions caused by COVID-19. His YouTube account was removed in late September 2021 for breaking the company's new policies on vaccine misinformation.In a January 23, 2022 speech at an anti-vaccination rally in Washington D.C., Kennedy said: \"Even in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you can hide in the attic like Anne Frank did\u2026Today the mechanisms are being put in place that will make it so none of us can run, none of us can hide.\" The Auschwitz Memorial stated on Twitter: \"Exploiting of the tragedy of people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured & murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany - including children like Anne Frank - in a debate about vaccines & limitations during global pandemic is a sad symptom of moral & intellectual decay.\" Two days later, Kennedy apologized for his comment.\n\n\n=== Views on the murder of Martha Moxley ===\nIn January 2003, Kennedy wrote a controversial article in The Atlantic Monthly about the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut, in which he insists that his cousin Michael Skakel's indictment \"was triggered by an inflamed media, and that an innocent man is now in prison.\" The article argues that there is more evidence suggesting that Kenneth Littleton, the Skakel family's live-in tutor, killed Moxley. He also calls Dominick Dunne the \"driving force\" behind Skakel's prosecution. In July 2016, Kennedy released a book titled Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn't Commit. In 2017, the rights to Kennedy's book were optioned by FX Productions to develop a multi-part television series.\n\n\n=== Views on JFK and RFK assassinations ===\nOn the evening of January 11, 2013, Charlie Rose interviewed Kennedy and his sister Rory at the Winspear Opera House in Dallas as a part of then Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings' hand-chosen committee's yearlong program of celebrating the life and presidency of John F. Kennedy. On the assassination of John F. Kennedy, he said his father was \"fairly convinced\" Lee Harvey Oswald had not acted alone and privately believed the Warren Commission report was a \"shoddy piece of craftsmanship\". According to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr in January 2013: \"The evidence at this point I think is very, very convincing that it was not a lone gunman\". The 2013 edition of JFK and the Unspeakable was endorsed by Kennedy, who said it had moved him to visit Dealey Plaza, the site of his uncle's assassination, for the first time.Kennedy does not believe Sirhan Sirhan was responsible for the assassination of his father, Robert F. Kennedy, and visited the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, San Diego, in December 2017 to meet Sirhan. After meeting Sirhan, he came to the conclusion there was a second gunman and gave his support for a reinvestigation of the assassination.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== General interests ===\nKennedy is a licensed master falconer and has trained hawks since he was 11. He breeds hawks and falcons and is also licensed as a raptor propagator and a wildlife rehabilitator. He holds permits for Federal Game Keeper, Bird Bander, and Scientific Collector. He was President of the New York State Falconry Association from 1988 to 1991. In 1987, while on Governor Mario Cuomo's New York State Falconry Advising Committee, Kennedy authored the examination to qualify apprentice falconers given by New York State. Later that year he wrote the New York State Apprentice Falconer's Manual,  which was published by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and continues in use today.Kennedy is also a whitewater kayaker. His father introduced him and his siblings to whitewater kayaking during early trips down the Green and Yampa Rivers in Utah and Colorado, the Columbia River, the Middle Fork Salmon in Idaho, and the Upper Hudson Gorge. From 1976 to 1981, Kennedy was a partner and guide at a whitewater company, \"Utopian\", based in West Forks, Maine. He organized and led several \"first-descent\" whitewater expeditions to Latin America including three hitherto unexplored rivers: the Apurimac, Peru, in 1975; the Atrato, Colombia, in 1979; and the Caroni, Venezuela, in 1982. He made an early descent of Great Whale River in Northern Quebec, in 1993, and has made many trips to Patagonia, Chile, to run the Biob\u00edo River, the Futaleuf\u00fa and other whitewater rivers.\nIn 2015, he took two of his sons to the Yukon to visit Mount Kennedy and run the Alsek River, a whitewater river fed by the Alsek Glacier. Mount Kennedy had been Canada's highest unclimbed peak, when the Canadian Government named it for the assassinated American president, in 1964. In 1965, his father Robert F. Kennedy was the first person to climb Mount Kennedy.\n\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nOn April 3, 1982, Kennedy married Emily Ruth Black (b. 1957), whom he had met at the University of Virginia School of Law. They had two children: Robert Francis \"Bobby\" Kennedy III (b. 1984; married to writer, peace activist and former CIA officer Amaryllis Fox) and Kathleen Alexandra Kennedy (b. 1988). The couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1994.On April 15, 1994, Kennedy married Mary Kathleen Richardson (1959\u20132012) aboard a research vessel on the Hudson River.  They had four children: Conor Richardson Kennedy (b. 1994), Kyra LeMoyne Kennedy (b. 1995), William Finbar \"Finn\" Kennedy (b. 1997), and Aidan Caohman Vieques Kennedy (b. 2001). On May 12, 2010, Kennedy filed for divorce from Mary; three days later she was charged with drunk driving.

In February 2021, Corbett was highlighted in the Time's \"Time100 Next\" list under the category of Innovators, with a profile written by Anthony Fauci.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCorbett was born in Hurdle Mills, North Carolina on January 26, 1986, to Rhonda Brooks. She grew up in Hillsborough, North Carolina, where she had a large family of step-siblings and foster siblings.Corbett went to Oak Lane Elementary School in Roxboro and A.L. Stanback Middle School in Hillsborough. Her fourth grade teacher, Myrtis Bradsher, recalls recognizing Corbett's talent at an early age and encouraging Kizzy's mother to place her in advanced classes. \"I always thought she is going to do something one day. She dotted i's and crossed t's. The best in my 30 years of teaching,\" Bradsher said in a 2020 interview with The Washington Post.In 2004, Corbett graduated from Orange High School in Hillsborough, North Carolina. In 2008, Corbett received a B.S. in biological sciences and sociology from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), as a student in the Meyerhoff Scholars Program. Corbett is among a cohort of recent UMBC graduates (also including Kaitlyn Sadtler) who have risen to prominence in biomedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2014, Corbett received a PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For her doctoral work, Corbett worked in Sri Lanka to study the role of human antibodies in dengue virus pathogenesis.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile in high school, Corbett realized that she wanted to pursue a scientific career, and as part of an American Chemical Society-sponsored program called Project SEED, spent her summer holiday working in research laboratories, one of which was at UNC's Kenan Labs with organic chemist James Morkin. In 2005, she was a summer intern at Stony Brook University in Gloria Viboud's lab where she studied Yersinia pseudotuberculosis pathogenesis. From 2006 to 2007, she worked as a lab tech in Susan Dorsey's lab at the University of Maryland School of Nursing.\nAfter earning her bachelor's degree, from 2006 to 2009, Corbett was a biological sciences trainer at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where she worked alongside Dr. Barney S. Graham. At the NIH, Corbett worked on the pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus as well as on a project focused on innovative vaccine platform advancement.From 2009 to 2014, Corbett studied human antibody responses to dengue virus in Sri Lankan children under the supervision of Aravinda de Silva at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill). She studied how people produce antibodies in response to dengue fever, and how the genetics of dengue fever impact the severity of a disease. From April to May 2014, as part of her research for her dissertation, Corbett worked as a visiting scholar at Genetech Research Institute in Colombo, Sri Lanka.In October 2014, Corbett became a research fellow working as a viral immunologist at the NIH. Her research aims to uncover mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and host immunity. She specifically focuses on development of novel vaccines for coronaviridae. Her early research considered the development of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) vaccine antigens. During this time, she identified a simple way to make coronavirus spike proteins that are stabilized in a conformation that renders them more immunogenic and manufacturable, in collaboration with researchers at Scripps Research Institute and Dartmouth College.In December 2021, Corbett was assigned to Boston's COVID-19 advisory committee by mayor Wu.\n\n\n=== Development of COVID-19 vaccine ===\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Corbett started working on a vaccine to protect people from coronavirus disease. Recognizing that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Corbett's team utilized previous knowledge of optimal coronavirus proteins to tackle COVID-19. S proteins form a \u201ccrown\u201d on the surface of coronaviruses and are crucial for engagement of host cell receptors and the initiation of membrane fusion in coronavirus disease. This makes them a particularly vulnerable target for coronavirus prophylactics and therapeutics. Based on her previous research, Corbett's team, in collaboration with Jason McLellan and other investigators at The University of Texas at Austin, transplanted stabilizing mutations from SARS-CoV S protein into SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. She was part of the NIH team who helped solve the cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Her prior research suggested that messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding S protein could be used to excite the immune response to produce protective antibodies against coronavirus disease 2019.To manufacture and test the COVID-19 vaccine Corbett's team partnered with Moderna, a biotechnology company, to rapidly enter animal studies. Subsequently, the vaccine entered Phase 1 clinical trial only 66 days after the virus sequence was released. The trial, to be completed in at least 45 people, is a dose escalation study in the form of two injections separated by 28 days. In December 2020, the Institute's Director, Anthony Fauci said: \"Kizzy is an African American scientist who is right at the forefront of the development of the vaccine.\"  In the Time's profile, Fauci wrote that Corbett has \"been central to the development of the Moderna mRNA vaccine and the Eli Lilly therapeutic monoclonal antibody that were first to enter clinical trials in the U.S.\" and that \"her work will have a substantial impact on ending the worst respiratory-disease pandemic in more than 100 years.\" Corbett's work afforded her the opportunity to be a part of the National Institutes of Health team that had Donald Trump at the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center in March 2020. When asked about her involvement with the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Corbett said, \"To be living in this moment where I have the opportunity to work on something that has imminent global importance\u2026it's just a surreal moment for me\". Corbett stated she cried when the efficacy results showed the mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine worked.\n\n\n=== Public statements related to COVID-19 ===\nCorbett has called for the public to be cautious and respectful of one another during the COVID-19 pandemic, explaining that regular hand washing and sneezing into one's elbow can help to minimize the spread of the virus. She has also emphasized that we should not stigmatize people who may be from areas where the virus started.Corbett has worked to rebuild trust with vaccine-hesitant populations such as the Black community. For example, she presented education about the COVID-19 vaccine development to Black Health Matters in October 2020. Her race has been a focus of government outreach; after a study released by the NAACP and others revealed that only 14% of black Americans believe a COVID-19 vaccine will be safe, NIAID Director Fauci was explicit: \"the first thing you might want to say to my African American brothers and sisters is that the vaccine that you're going to be taking was developed by an African American woman.\"\n\n\n=== Controversial tweets ===\nIn May 2020, The Washington Post reported that Corbett had been scrutinized for tweets lamenting the lack of diversity on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, as well as for her responses to other tweets about data that African Americans were disproportionately dying from the virus. Responding to a tweet in which someone else claimed that the virus \u201cis a way to get rid of us,\u201d Corbett responded: \u201cSome have gone as far to call it genocide. I plead the fifth.\u201d. Fox News news host Tucker Carlson read several of Corbett's tweets on his show, accusing her of \"spouting lunatic conspiracy theories.\" Another Fox News article said she \"adopts a strikingly casual and conspiratorial tone.\" After the controversy, Corbett scaled back her use of social media and stopped appearing on television. Texas Southern University professor Robert Bullard and President of the National Medical Association (an organization of Black physicians) Oliver Brooks defended Corbett overall, although Brooks expressed concern about her tweet on genocide, saying \u201cIt\u2019s subjective. I wouldn\u2019t want to go there. I really don\u2019t believe that. We\u2019re dying at a higher rate but \u2026 that one just doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d.\n\n\n== Academic service ==\nCorbett regularly shares information on Twitter and takes part in programs to inspire youth in underserved communities.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nUNC Frank Porter Graham Honor Society\n2002\u20132004: American Chemical Society, Project SEED at UNC\u2010Chapel Hill\n2006: National Institute of Health, NIH Undergraduate Scholarship\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County, Meyerhoff Scholar\n2013: Third Pan American Dengue Research Network Meeting Travel Award\n2021: Highlighted by Time magazine in the 2021 \"Time100 Next\" list, under the category of Innovators\nIn recognition of her work on the vaccine, Orange County, North Carolina named January 12, 2021 \"Dr. Kizzy Corbett Day\".\n\n\n== Selected works and publications ==\nCorbett, Kizzmekia Shanta (August 2014).

The manga has been sold in 25 countries, while the anime has been broadcast in 40 countries.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nJimmy Kudo (Japanese name: Shinichi Kudo) is a high school detective who sometimes works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is ambushed and incapacitated by a member of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. In an attempt to murder the young detective, they force-fed him a dangerous experimental drug. However, it turns him into a kid instead of killing him. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases. Nonetheless, after Kudo solves one, he will use Dr. Agasa's hidden tranquilizer to sedate Richard and then uses a voice changer to simulate his voice to reveal the solution. He also enrolls in a local elementary school where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with other characters, including his neighbor, Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena Sebastian (Sonoko Suzuki), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), assorted police detectives from different regions, and a phantom thief called the Kaito Kid.\nKudo later encounters an elementary school transfer student, Anita Hailey (Ai Haibara), who reveals herself to be a former member of the Black Organization and the creator of the experimental drug that shrunk him. She too had ingested it to evade the pursuit of the organization. She soon joins the Junior Detectives. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization, Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as a spy.\n\n\n== Production ==\nCase Closed was conceived in 1994, during the rise of mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the series The Kindaichi Case Files; the first chapter appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday on January 19. Aoyama cites the stories of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences on his work. When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones. Aoyama's older brother is a scientist who helps him out with the \"gimmicks\" in the series. Each case spans several chapters (except for a handful of shorter cases that only span one), and is resolved at the end where characters explain the details of their solutions in simple terms; an online database consisting of all the cases from the manga was launched in 2007. In 2007, Aoyama hinted he had an ending planned out but does not intend to end the series yet.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nCase Closed, written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama, has been serialized in Shogakukan's sh\u014dnen manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday since January 19, 1994. Case Closed became the 24th longest running manga series, with over 1000 chapters released in Japan, and the first series with over 1000 chapters published in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday. Shogakukan has collected its chapters into individual tank\u014dbon volumes. The first volume was released on June 18, 1994. On October 18, 2021, the series reached one hundred volumes. One Piece author, Eiichiro Oda, whose series achieved the same feat a month before, sent congratulations to Aoyama.Viz Media announced its acquisition of the series for North America on June 1, 2004. Following Funimation's localization, Viz released the series as Case Closed and took their character names to keep consistency between the two media. Viz Media released the first volume in September 2004 and began releasing digital editions in 2013. Gollancz licensed and distributed 15 of Viz Media's volumes in the United Kingdom before ceasing publication of manga. (Viz Media has since re-released them). In 2014 Shogakukan Asia began its own English localization of the series for Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries as Detective Conan. Laura Thornton of CBR.com, citing the common Japanese ownership in both Shogakukan Asia and Viz, described the Singapore version as, compared to the Viz one, \"completely identical, word-for-word, even -- save for the names and the Detective Conan logo\".The manga has also been localized in other regions such as China, France, Germany and Indonesia.  (Localizations in Scandinavia ceased one by one, Finland being the last in 2013, when the publisher shut down the entire manga division).\n\n\n=== Spin-offs ===\n\nGosho Aoyama's assistants have written an anthology series of Case Closed which are released irregularly.A spin-off manga series, titled Detective Conan: The Culprit Hanzawa, by Mayuko Kanba, began in the July 2017 issue of Shogakukan's Sh\u014dnen Sunday S, released on May 25, 2017.Another spin-off manga series, illustrated by Takahiro Arai with supervision by Aoyama, titled Detective Conan: Zero's Tea Time started in issue #24 of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday on May 9, 2018.

Over 1000 episodes have aired in Japan since the anime's premiere on January 8, 1996, making it the fifteenth longest anime series to date. Initially, Shogakukan collected and released the episodes on VHS video cassettes from June 1996 to October 2006. Four hundred and twenty-six episodes were released on VHS until Shogakukan abandoned the format and switched over to DVDs, starting over from the first episode. For the fifteenth anniversary of the anime series, the series was made available for video on demand. The series celebrated its 25th anniversary in January 2021, and the \"Moonlight Sonata Murder Case\" episode (11th episode of the series) was given the remake treatment as the first part of its celebration, which featured the latest staff and production techniques, and classical pianist Aimi Kobayashi performed Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 for the episode. It aired on March 6, 2021.In 2003, the first 104 episodes, as well as the first six movies were licensed by Funimation for distribution in North America, under the title Case Closed because of legal considerations. The Case Closed anime has also been released in other languages such as French, German and Italian. Case Closed debuted on Cartoon Network as part of their Adult Swim programming block on May 24, 2004; no more than 50 episodes were licensed from Funimation due to low ratings. The Canadian channel YTV picked up the Case Closed series and broadcast 22 episodes between April 7, 2006, and September 2, 2006, before taking it off the air. Funimation made the series available with the launch of the Funimation Channel in November 2005; it was temporary available on Colours TV during its syndication with the Funimation Channel.  Case Closed was later broadcast in North America on NHK's cable network TV Japan. Funimation lost the rights to the series in 2018. Crunchyroll began simulcasting the series in October 2014, starting with episode 754. In September 2020, Crunchyroll began streaming the first 43 episodes (the two-part episodes 11-12 considered as a single episode).A separate English adaptation of the series was made by Voiceovers Unlimited Pte Ltd. in Singapore. Another one by Animax Asia premiered in the Philippines on January 18, 2006, under the name Detective Conan. Because Animax were unable to obtain further TV broadcast rights, their version comprised only 52 episodes. The series continued with reruns until August 7, 2006, when it was removed from the station. Both the Singapore and Philippines versions used Japanese character names. The California-based channel United Television Broadcasting (UTB) aired Detective Conan with English subtitles from 2011 until 2014, until episode 421.Funimation also released DVDs of their dubbed series beginning August 24, 2004.

Hanabee Entertainment licensed the series for distribution in Australia.In January 2016, 52 episodes of the anime appeared on Netflix, initially under its original title Detective Conan before changing to its English moniker Case Closed. The episodes were listed as \"season one\", although in reality they are episodes #748 to #799. The episodes were only available in Japanese, but were subtitled. The availability was likely part of Netflix's efforts to expand its anime catalog. In January 2021, Netflix removed the episodes.

It also has other tourist attractions related to Detective Conan, including a Detective Conan themed airport and train station, and it is promoted as Conan Town.In 2018, Case Closed caught the attention of American late night talk show host Conan O'Brien, who discussed the character Conan Edogawa as well as Conan Town in his talk show Conan, and visited the town in September 2018.\n\n\n==== Sales ====\nAs of 2021, the Case Closed manga had over 250 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling manga series, having been sold in 25 countries. In Japan, individual volumes frequently appear on the lists of best-selling manga. Case Closed was the 19th best selling manga in 2011, with 2,120,091 copies sold. Nikkei Entertainment magazine published a list of top 50 manga creators by sales since January 2010, in its September 2011 issue; Gosho Aoyama, the author of Case Closed was ranked 16th, with 3,320,000 copies sold. It was the 17th best selling manga in 2012, with 2,430,572 copies sold. In 2013 Case Closed became the 24th best selling manga, with 1,966,206 copies sold.Licensed merchandise based on Detective Conan are sold in Asia. In Japan, Detective Conan licensed merchandise sold \u00a52.89 billion in 2003, \u00a517.29 billion during 2005\u20132008, and \u00a59.03 billion during 2010\u20132012, adding up to at least \u00a529.21 billion ($366.08 million) sold in Japan between 2003 and 2012.The first volume of Case Closed appeared thrice in the top ten selling lists, right after its premiere, the same volume has also appeared in the Diamond Comic Distributors's ranking list. Later-published volumes have appeared on the New York Times Manga Best Sellers lists.\n\n\n=== Historical and cultural significance ===\nCase Closed began its publication during the \"Lost Decade,\" which was a long period of economic recession in Japan during the 1990s after the economic bubble of the 1980s burst. During this period, Japan also saw an increase in violent crimes committed by teenagers which was a growing cause for concern. The political and cultural turmoil of this period contributed to the widespread popularity of Case Closed in Japan, where audiences wished to escape from these crises. The \"boy detective\" trope made a resurgence in this decade and has remained popular since. The story of Case Closed is often read as an optimistic view of the capacity of children to improve society and to inspire hope for the future. The adult detectives and police officers in Case Closed are shown to be inept at solving crimes and it is ultimately Conan and the Junior Detective Club who solve cases and inspire the child audience to do the same. This can influence children and young adults\u2019 perceptions of the police and other authorities. It can also generate a positive view of vigilante justice and anti-police sentiments in children that may undermine authoritative figures.Case Closed has clear influences from western and eastern cultures, and it attempts to unite the two and show a modernized Japan. The designs of the characters in Case Closed are inspired by western styles, such as Conan and Richard's suits or Rachel's hairstyle, while the backgrounds show a modern, urbanized Japanese landscape. At the same time, characters also take part in traditional Japanese customs such as using chopsticks when eating or using traditional greetings when characters return to their homes. These practices demonstrate to the audience that modernity and tradition can function together.Case Closed  uses Japanese pop music (J-pop) in its opening and ending songs. Prior to the mid 1990s, anime music was considered its own genre and was separate from J-pop. Case Closed was one of the first anime programs to include J-pop specifically in the program. As a result, today J-pop is much more commonly used in anime and J-pop artists frequently use anime as a promotional platform for their work.Case Closed features Japanese landmarks throughout the show as the setting for many episodes. The characters visit religious temples, beaches, mountain ranges and many other real and fictionalized locations in Japan that demonstrate the country's natural beauty and historical landmarks. Case Closed episodes also include elements of Japanese folklore such as the Tengu and the Shinigami, as well as more globally recognizable figures like aliens and vampires. However, the existence of these creatures is always debunked as part of the criminal's plan in an episode.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nIn the United States, Case Closed received praises from Mania.com's Eduardo M. Chavez and IGN's A. E. Sparrow for its stories\u2014telling the mysteries and how they were unfolded by the investigations of Conan and gang. Sparrow called the style of the series a mix of Scooby-Doo and Sherlock Holmes, while Chavez believed the manga had appeal to readers of all ages. Melissa Sternenberg from THEM Anime Reviews reviewed and praised its animation and plot. ActiveAnime's reviewers commented on complex character design and the \"spirit\" that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it. The series is also said to better suit the more matured audience. In the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for international English-speaking audiences, mostly North American. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it pointless to change the names of the characters, and Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical. The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of Case Closed for Anime News Network; he said that while the main characters sounded like \"real people\", the secondary ones \"[came] off as caricatures\". Lori Lancaster of Mania.com described Case Closed as \"a clever series that had mysteries at every corner\", noting the \"bizarre\" and \"interesting\" nature of each case. IGN's Chris Wyatt was positive to the manner the cases were set up, relating them to Agatha Christie's locked-room mysteries. He described the series as \"Inspector Gadget meets Law & Order but in an anime style.\" His colleague, Harris, however, expressed annoyance with repetitive elements in the show and the contrived methods the series uses to keep Conan's identity a secret from certain characters.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nIt won the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award for the sh\u014dnen category in 2001, and respondents in an online poll for Japanese citizens in their mid-twenties voted Case Closed as one of the top three manga they wanted to continue running in publication.  In France, the series was nominated for the Angoul\u00eame Festival Graphic Novel award among the Japanese selection. The series ranked on About.com's top continuing manga series of 2010, under the title \"Best Underappreciated Gem: Shonen\" category.Several of the franchise's films were nominated for awards in their home country. The ninth film was nominated for the feature film category at the 5th Annual Tokyo Anime Awards, and the next five films were nominees for the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year in their respective years of release.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTakuya Furukawa; Tim Gene (March 2008).

Fourteen schools in England had closed by 28 February. Loughborough University reported a student confirmed to have the virus after recent travel to Italy, and indicated that several staff members and students began self-isolation.\n\n\n=== Mid-March \u2013 nationwide shutdown ===\nOn 18 March, the Welsh government announced that all schools in Wales would be closing by 20 March. On the same day, the First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon announced that Scottish schools would also be closing from 20 March, and may not reopen before the summer. Later that day, it was announced that schools in Northern Ireland would close to pupils immediately and to staff on 20 March. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of State for Education, Gavin Williamson announced that schools in England would close from 20 March for an unspecified length of time. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that schools would still look after the children of key workers, and vulnerable children, and for England the Department for Education published guidance on eligibility on 19 March.The Coronavirus Act 2020, which came into force on 25 March, gave the relevant ministers and departments across the UK powers to shut educational institutions and childcare premises.The UK government also announced that GCSE and A Level exams were to be cancelled, an unprecedented action in UK educational history, and that grades were to be given out based on predicted grades and teacher assessment.\n\n\n=== June to September \u2013 reopening ===\n\nPrimary schools in England began to open more widely on 1 June, beginning with nursery classes and children in the year groups Reception (aged 4\u20135), Year 1 (aged 5\u20136) and Year 6 (aged 10\u201311), although many schools and local councils delayed until after this date. It was planned that all primary-age pupils would be back in school by the end of June, but on 9 June the government announced that primary schools would not reopen further to other year groups due to concerns on the impact this could have on the rate of infection. Instead, most primary school children returned to classes in early September, almost six months after schools closed.Secondary schools in England reopened for year groups 10 (aged 14\u201315) and 12 (aged 16\u201317) from 15 June. However, schools had been instructed to continue to primarily educate young people in these age groups at home, and to keep face-to-face lessons to a minimum. Secondary students returned in full at the start of the new academic year in September.School attendance was not compulsory for pupils in England, regardless of whether they had a place available or not, until the start of the 2020\u201321 academic year.Meanwhile, schools in Wales reopened on 29 June, and although all year groups returned, until the summer holidays attendance was non-compulsory and part-time. In the new academic year schools reopened at full capacity with some changes to ensure social distancing remained in place. Scottish schools reopened between the 11 and 18 August; it was at first intended that they would operate a \"blended model\" of part-time study at school and at home, though it was later decided that schools would aim to open full-time as soon as they returned. Schools in Northern Ireland reopened for \"key cohorts\" (students studying for exams or transitioning between schools) in August, and for others in September.\n\n\n=== December to January \u2013 resurgence and new mass closures ===\nAmidst exponential growth of cases, on 13 December the London borough of Greenwich instructed its schools to switch to remote learning. The London boroughs of Islington and Waltham Forest took similar steps the following day, while Redbridge council stating it would support its schools  if they want to move to online teaching. Gavin Williamson ordered the schools to stay open for face-to-face teaching, and Greenwich council reversed its decision in the face of threats of legal action from the government. In December, the Scottish government announced that schools would only be open for children of key workers and the most vulnerable children for the first week of term, with online beginning for most people on 11 January.After the Christmas break, teaching unions recommended keeping schools closed. On 4 January, the governments of Wales, Scotland and then England introduced further measures to deal with the second wave. Schools in Wales would remain shut for in-person teaching in favour of online teaching; some schools had been due to resume in-person teaching on 6 January. In Scotland a new lockdown included postponing the opening of schools for face-to-face teaching until 1 February, instead moving to online teaching. In England, schools had already started to open when they were instructed to switch to remote learning until at least the February half term. Schools in Northern Ireland also closed, although nurseries and special schools were kept open.\n\n\n=== February to present \u2013 second reopening ===\nYounger primary school children in Scotland and Wales returned to the classroom from 22 February. All primary schools in England reopened on 8 March whilst secondary schools opened in a staggered manner beginning on that date. Northern Ireland's youngest schoolchildren also returned on the same date. In Wales and Scotland, older primary school pupils returned to lessons and secondary schools began to reopen on 15 March. Northern Ireland's oldest school students returned to studying in person on 22 March.\n\n\n=== December to present \u2013 Omicron variant ===\nIn December 2021, the Department for Education asked retired teachers to return to teaching in England from January. This was in anticipation of an increase in staff absence due to the Omicron Covid variant. The Department of Education in Northern Ireland made similar requests to recently retired teachers.Amid ongoing omicron related fears, new guidelines released in Wales on 1 January stated that whether pupils would be educated online or in the classroom would be delegated to individual local authorities and schools. The following day, it was announced that face mask requirements would be tightened in England on a temporary basis for secondary school pupils as part of the measures to combat Omicron.\n\n\n== Schooling in Lockdown ==\n\n\n=== Home learning ===\nStudents were encouraged to keep on studying at home with many parents becoming responsible for their children's education. Many teachers continued to set work for and interact with pupils online. Fitness coach Joe Wicks released a series of training videos targeted primarily at schoolchildren to help them remain active whilst at home. BBC Bitesize also provided a range of resources to help children, young people and parents. The Bitesize website had 1.6 million individual users on the day its lockdown learning programme was launched whilst CBBC had a 436% increase in viewership during the slot when educational programming was broadcast.Research conducted by the Office of National Statistics suggested that school aged children in Great Britain completed on average 11 hours of study at home per week this was roughly the same regardless of how many children or adults were in the household, however, children tended to do less schoolwork if they were younger or when there was a child under five-years-old in the household. Other studies suggested that many students had completed little or no academic work during the lockdown.\n\n\n=== School exams ===\n\nOn 20 March 2020, the government announced that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all secondary education examinations due to be held in 2020 were cancelled. As a result, an alternative method had to be designed and implemented at short notice to determine the qualification grades to be given to students for that year. In their place, qualification grades were to be based on teacher-predicted grades combined with a moderation process to be defined by Ofqual. An outcry ensued when, after the release of the A level results on 13 August, it became apparent that the moderation algorithm used had delivered some controversial results. Following increasing pressure to and public opinion, the regulator decided to withdraw the computed results, and to regrade students based solely on the original teacher predictions. Before the GCSE grades were released on 20 August, it was decided that they would be based on the teacher predictions too. Similar moderation systems and reversals to teachers predictions took place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.In November 2020, the Welsh government cancelled GCSEs and A-levels for 2021 with grades decided based on classroom assessment. The following month the Scottish government cancelled higher exams for 2021, with teachers deciding on final grade. When schools in England and Northern Ireland generally closed to face-to-face teaching in early 2021 the respective governments cancelled GCSEs and A-levels due to take place that year; grades in England would be awarded based on teachers' estimates rather than the algorithm used in the summer of 2020.\n\n\n=== School inspections ===\nOfsted suspended routine inspections from 17 March 2020, and the Secretary of State for Education issued successive monthly notices which suspended sections of the Education Act 2005, extending until at least the end of June 2021. The Independent Schools Inspectorate also suspended routine work in March 2020, although the Department for Education could still commission Material Change Visits, Additional Inspections and Progress Monitoring Visits.\n\n\n== Universities ==\n\n\n=== March 2020 \u2013 Closures ===\nCambridge University was criticised for their incoherent response to the pandemic which required international students and staff to make arrangements to return home with only two days' notice. On 13 March, students and staff were advised that international travel was discouraged and university facilities would stay open at reduced capacity. On 18 March, Vice Chancellor Stephen Toope announced a sudden U-turn: all university buildings would be indefinitely shut to staff and students from the afternoon of Friday 20 March, and all students were strongly encouraged to leave Cambridge. The president of Cambridge UCU criticised this sudden shutdown, saying it would exacerbate the pandemic as students from countries with weaker healthcare provisions were forced to return home.Over a thousand Cambridge students signed an open letter requesting to have multiple assessment options in lieu of the cancelled examinations, including the option to retake part or all of the academic year in 2020\u201321.Coventry University first suspended graduation ceremonies due to be held in March and April, and from 20 March, suspended all face-to-face teaching, in favour of on-line delivery. Other higher education institutions took similar steps around the same time. Many students from overseas, who could not afford to travel or found their flights cancelled, were unable to return home.\n\n\n=== September 2020 \u2013 Reopening ===\n\nFor the 2020/21 academic year, most universities adopted a blended learning approach with a mixture of online and in-person teaching. In early September the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies warned \"It is highly likely that there will be significant outbreaks associated with higher education, and asymptomatic transmission may make these harder to detect\", though noted that universities were \"well advanced in their plans to manage their campus and delivery of education\". At the time, the number of confirmed cases in the UK was increasing.On 25 September, Manchester Metropolitan University locked down two of its halls of accommodation, placing 1,700 students in isolation for 14 days after 127 across the halls had tested positive.According to an assessment from the Department for Education in September 2020, 39% of students were enrolled in courses that were classroom based, and may be adapted to online delivery, 22% in subjects that required some in-person teaching, and 39% in courses with \"extensive contact hours or practical elements\".On 6 November 2020, students at the University of Manchester found that fences had been erected around their halls of residence, preventing access in or out of the buildings; subsequent protests involved tearing down the fences, though the university claimed there had been no intention to restrict access.In March 2021, students at the University of Manchester held a vote of no confidence in the leadership of their Vice-Chancellor, Nancy Rothwell, due to her handling of the university's response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the vote passed with 89% in favour.\n\n\n== COVID-19 in schools ==\nSAGE advised that opening schools will likely increase the rate of COVID-19 transmission while noting that it is \"difficult to quantify the level of transmission taking place specifically within schools compared to other settings\". The NASUWT teachers' union contacted 28 local authorities for data on COVID-19 rates amongst school staff in the autumn term. Of the three that responded, rates amongst staff were much higher than the levels in their local authorities.The Schools Infection Survey monitors infection rates in staff and students at schools in England. As part of the survey, 10,000 people were tested for COVID-19 in November 2020; 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive. The study excluded people with clear symptoms as they should not be attending school. SAGE noted that the \"data is unweighted, and so cannot be generalised to the school population as a whole.\" Minutes from a SAGE meeting in November recorded that there is evidence that pre-school and primary children are less susceptible to catching COVID-19 than adults,  though it is unclear whether secondary school children are also less susceptible.As of 4 January 2021, the Department for Education does not have information on how many school staff have died of COVID-19, and has not released its data on illness rates.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA report published in November 2020 by Ofsted on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children in England after their first period out of school found that whilst some children had coped well with lockdown often enjoying the extra time with their families others had struggled, regressing academically and losing basic skills such as young children who had previously been potty trained returning to wearing nappies.  The report indicated that children with special educational needs had been particularly badly impacted by the pandemic.Polling suggested that three quarters of parents felt that teaching their children at home had made them more knowledgeable. Whilst, 29% said they had learned something new from the experience and the same number thought it had made them a better parent. 37% believed they were now better equipped to help their children with schoolwork in the future. Between September 2020 and April 2021, the number of children across the UK being taken out of school to be educated at home on a permanent basis increased by 75% in comparison to previous years.Reporting conducted in late 2021 into the impact of the COVID-19 on schools in Scotland suggested that pupils behaviour had worsened since the pandemic and that academic standards had fallen. The pandemic had reportedly impacted children's development with unusually immature classes in their first year of secondary school needing to be treated like primary school pupils. Frequent absences among teachers due to needing to isolate was leading to lessons being run at maximum size adding to issues with discipline whilst common absences among the students also disrupted their progress. Whilst, some pupils had simply not returned to school after lockdown and whereabouts were unknown.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCOVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\nEducation in the United Kingdom\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGuidance and document collections at GOV.UK:\n\nEducation and childcare during coronavirus\nOfsted: coronavirus (COVID-19) rolling update\nCollection: Vocational, technical and other general qualifications in 2021 \u2013 Ofqual",

Mathematical modelling has shown that transmission of an outbreak may be delayed by closing schools. However, effectiveness depends on the contacts children maintain outside of school. School closures appear effective in decreasing cases and deaths, particularly when enacted promptly. If school closures occur late relative to an outbreak, they are less effective and may not have any impact at all. Additionally, in some cases, the reopening of schools after a period of closure has resulted in increased infection rates. As closures tend to occur concurrently with other interventions such as public gathering bans, it can be difficult to measure the specific impact of school closures.During the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic in the United States, school closures and public gathering bans were associated with lower total mortality rates. Cities that implemented such interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality rates. Schools closed for a median duration of 4 weeks according to a study of 43 US cities' response to the Spanish Flu. School closures were shown to reduce morbidity from the Asian flu by 90% during the 1957\u201358 outbreak, and up to 50% in controlling influenza in the US, 2004\u20132008.Multiple countries successfully slowed the spread of infection through school closures during the 2009 H1N1 Flu pandemic. School closures in the city of Oita, Japan, were found to have successfully decreased the number of infected students at the peak of infection; however closing schools was not found to have significantly decreased the total number of infected students. Mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures were associated with a 29% to 37% reduction in influenza transmission rates. Early school closures in the United States delayed the peak of the 2009 H1N1 Flu pandemic. Despite the overall success of closing schools, a study of school closures in Michigan found that \"district level reactive school closures were ineffective.\"\n\nDuring the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in the UK, in an article titled \"Closure of schools during an influenza pandemic\" published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, a group of epidemiologists endorsed the closure of schools in order to interrupt the course of the infection, slow further spread and buy time to research and produce a vaccine. Having studied previous influenza pandemics including the 1918 flu pandemic, the influenza pandemic of 1957 and the 1968 flu pandemic, they reported on the economic and workforce effect school closure would have, particularly with a large percentage of doctors and nurses being women, of whom half had children under the age of 16. They also looked at the dynamics of the spread of influenza in France during French school holidays and noted that cases of flu dropped when schools closed and re-emerged when they re-opened. They noted that when teachers in Israel went on strike during the flu season of 1999\u20132000, visits to doctors and the number of respiratory infections dropped by more than a fifth and more than two fifths respectively.\n\n\n== Hazard controls ==\n\nFor schools and childcare facilities, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread. When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as postponing or cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms. When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.As the pandemic progresses, schools may continue with remote learning or decide to reopen. Strategies such as cohorting, rotating schedules, eating lunch in the classroom, and utilizing outdoor spaces are some ways to minimize close contact. Additional precautions include face masks, hand sanitizer stations, rearranging classrooms to enable physical distancing, and frequent cleaning. The CDC made a School Decision Tree to aid administrators in the planning process for reopening. The American Academy of Pediatrics urges re-entry policies need to be flexible and responsive as new information about the virus emerges.The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine states that in-person instruction for grades K-5 and students with special needs should be prioritized to prevent children from falling behind. Younger children are at higher risk of suffering from long-term academic consequences and developmental deficits without in-person learning.\n\n\n== Academic integrity ==\nThe impact on academic integrity has been observed around the world. A rise in contract cheating, academic file-sharing, and exam cheating were identified as particularly problematic. Since  learning has been predominantly remote since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, cheating has become far easier for students. There is no remorse from students, whose priorities are not always comprehending the material, but rather, succeeding in class. From the point of view of teachers' rights, online education has exposed various as yet unresolved legal issues, especially in terms of copyright and how to deal with unapproved misuse of lectures.Many institutions turned to commercial services to take over exam proctoring, but almost immediately concerns were raised about student privacy, surveillance, and the impact on student mental health.The lack of student to teacher interaction has also led students to feel less passionate about the integrity of their work. This leaves students to turn in half-completed assignments, get the answers from their friends in class, or turn in nothing at all simply because education has become less important due to COVID-19.\n\n\n== Gender disparities ==\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has widened the gender gap in education between females and males. The rapid incline in infectious rates of COVID-19 has globally forced many females into the traditional roles as caretakers. Common gender disparities that impact a female's education during the pandemic are finances enabling higher dropout rates, domestic violence, child marriage, early pregnancy, and exploitation of child labor. Female caretakers drop out of schools to provide care for sick family members and/or become a source of income for their families. In settings with gender disparities in rates of school completion, girls are at increased risk of not returning to school after lockdown if tasked with income-generating activities or caretaking or they become pregnant. There is a correlation between increased unemployment rates with higher female school dropout rates. Malala Fund research estimates that as a result of the pandemic, 20 million girls in developing countries may never return to the classroom. Consequently, there is a decreased level of women returning to school, particularly in nations with poverty. Out of the total population of students enrolled in education globally, UNESCO estimates that over 89% are currently out of school because of COVID-19 closures. This represents 1.54 billion children, and youth enrolled in school or university, including nearly 743 million girls. During the pandemic, females attending school reported encountering technical challenges with remote learning. Using data from the National Study STEM faculty and students (NSSFS) collected 2020, the report describes gender disparities in experiences of transitioning to remote teaching/learning among US STEM faculty and students. According to the survey, females reported higher technical challenges in remote learning against their male counterparts. The two main areas that females found challenging in remote learning were adaptability to the course design and transitioning from face-to-face school to remote online learning curriculums. Countries with poverty reported increased gender disparities as families could not afford internet usage in low-income households to pay for female education. Additionally, there was a preference in male over female education as they were seen as sole providers. Over 111 million of these girls are living in the world's least developed countries where getting an education is already a struggle. These are contexts of extreme poverty, economic vulnerability, and crisis where gender disparities in education are highest. In Mali, Niger, and South Sudan \u2014 3 countries with some of the lowest enrolment and completion rates for girls \u2014 closures have forced over 4 million girls out of school. The broadened gap in gender disparities impacts female education that will exceed beyond the pandemic and seep into their futures. There have been several efforts by UNESCO and other organizations to raise funds for female education, but due to the financial hardships of the pandemic, those efforts have fallen short. Lack of government involvement in the issue and inability to address the increasing concerns of gender disparities in education during the pandemic has limited educational opportunities for females globally.\n\n\n== Racial disparities ==\nThe impact of COVID-19 on racial disparities in online learning during the pandemic has received research attention. A recent study from the Urban Institute covers some of these findings. Urban's study points to issues in access to a computer and internet. A 2018 survey of households showed that 48% of surveyed households of Alaskan Natives did not have access to computers compared to 35% of Black households, 35% Latinx, and 19% White. Minimal access to computers and the internet was found in 1.3 to 1.4 times as many Black and Hispanic households with school-aged children as it was in white households, with more than two out of five low-income households having just limited access.A 2021 report from the Black Education Research Collective analyzes the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Black education. It evaluates how Black students, parents, educators and community members experience systemic racism during COVID. The study seeks to show how the pandemic has interrupted education across the country, highlighting existing racial and economic inequities. The study also argues that even before the outbreak, students in vulnerable neighborhoods, primarily Black, Indigenous, and other majority-minority areas, faced disparities in everything from resources (ranging from books to counselors) to student-teacher ratios and extracurricular activities.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n26 January: China was the first country which instituted measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak including extending the Spring Festival holiday and became the first to close all universities and schools around the country.\n4 March: UNESCO released the first global numbers on school closures and affected students on 3 March. It reported that 22 countries on three continents had enacted preventive measures including the temporary closure of schools and universities, impacting 290.5 million students around the world. In reaction, UNESCO called on countries to support affected students and families and facilitate large-scale inclusive distance learning programmes.5 March: The majority of learners affected by COVID-19 emergency measures were located in China, with 233 million learners affected, followed by Japan at 16.5 million and Iran at 14.5 million.10 March: One in five students worldwide was \"staying away from school due to the COVID-19 crisis\" while another one in four was barred from higher education institutions according to UNESCO.13\u201316 March: National governments in 49 countries announced or implemented school closures on 13 March, including 39 countries which closed schools nationwide and 22 countries with localised school closures. By 16 March, this figure increased to 73 countries according to UNESCO.19 March: A total of 50% of the students worldwide were affected by school closures, corresponding to nationwide closures in 102 countries and local closures in 11 countries affecting 1 billion people.20 March: Over 70% of the world's learners were impacted by closures, with 124 country-wide school closures.27 March: Nearly 90 per cent of the world's student population was out of class.29 March: More than 1.5 billion children and other students were affected by nationwide school closures. Others were disrupted by localized closures.Mid-April: A total of 1.725 billion students globally had been affected by the closure of schools and higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the UNESCO Monitoring Report, 192 countries had implemented nationwide closures, affecting about 99% of the world's student population.\n30 June: The CDC revised its guidelines for institutes of primary, secondary, and tertiary education, in which it expressly did not recommend the universal testing of students and staff. Rather, the CDC only recommended testing people who are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms or who have come into contact with a known COVID-19 case.As of 12 January 2021, approximately 825 million learners are currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 23 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 40 are implementing local closures, impacting about 47 percent of the world's student population. 112 countries' schools are currently open.\n\n\n== School closures ==\n\n\n=== Country-wide closures ===\nNotes\na^  Data on enrolment in tertiary education programmes is not available.\nb^  Schools have started opening, but the majority remain closed.\nc^  While all schools are open, universities have the choice to remain open or not.\nd^  Universities are currently on school spring break, and hence closures not related to the coronavirus.\ne^  Universities have postponed the beginning of the academic year by two weeks to 16 March.\nf^  Most universities remain open.\ngg All educational institutions have opened.\n\n\n=== Localised closures ===\nAs of 12 January 2021, 40 countries have localised school closures. UNESCO estimates 473,933,356 learners are potentially at risk (pre-primary to upper-secondary education) and 77,938,904 learners are potentially at risk in tertiary education.\nNotes\na^  Figures correspond to total number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education (ISCED levels 0 to 3), as well as at tertiary education levels (ISCED levels 5 to 8) who could be affected should localised closures become countrywide. Enrolment figures based on latest UNESCO Institute of Statistics data.\nb^  All educational institutions are open.\n\n\n== Consequences of school closures ==\n\n \nSchool closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have shed a light on numerous issues affecting access to education, as well as broader socio-economic issues. As of 12 March, more than 370 million children and youth are not attending school because of temporary or indefinite country wide school closures mandated by governments in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. As of 29 March, nearly 90% of the world's learners were impacted by closures.According to the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF), the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 91% of students worldwide, with approximately 1.6 billion children and youngsters unable to attend physical schools due to temporary closures and lockdowns.Even when school closures are temporary, it carries high social and economic costs. The disruptions they cause affect people across communities, but their impact is more severe for disadvantaged children and their families including interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work. According to Studi Economici Dell'Ocse (OECD) studies, school performance hinges critically on maintaining close relationships with teachers. This is particularly true for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not have the parental support needed to learn on their own. Working parents are more likely to miss work when schools close in order to take care of their children, incurring wage loss in many instances and negatively impacting productivity. Localised school closures place burdens on schools as parents and officials redirect children to schools that are open.It is also highly likely that the COVID-19 pandemic and school closures will further exacerbate the learning crisis occurring across the globe. \n\n\n=== Unintended strain on healthcare system ===\nWomen make up almost 70% of the healthcare workforce, exposing them to a greater risk of infection. They often cannot attend work because of childcare obligations that result from school closures. In fact, in the U.S., the healthcare sector has one of the highest rates of childcare obligations in the broader economy, with approximately 28.8% of the workforce responsible for providing care to children aged 3\u201312. At best, this means that school closures put pressure on health workers in systems already strained by COVID-19 caseloads. At worst, this means that some medical professionals may not be present at health facilities altogether.\n\n\n=== Online learning ===\n\nOnline learning has become a critical lifeline for education, as institutions seek to minimize the potential for community transmission. Technology can enable teachers and students to access specialized materials well beyond textbooks, in multiple formats and in ways that can bridge time and space. Online learning solutions can take many forms, including high-tech solutions such as tablet-based adaptive learning software or low-tech solutions such as radio, sms, and television.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools across the world began conducting classes via videotelephony software such as Zoom, Google Classroom and/or Google Meet. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has created a framework to guide an education response to the COVID-19 pandemic for distance learning. Whenever this was possible, the ability to teach in real time significantly helped educators handle the transition, in comparison with their colleagues who had to rely on asynchronous instruction.\n\n\n==== Unequal access to technology ====\nLack of access to technology or fast, reliable internet access can prevent students in rural areas and from disadvantaged families. Lack of access to technology or good internet connectivity is an obstacle to continued learning, especially for students from disadvantaged families. Teachers have reported that students are more likely to complete assignments if they have access to internet at home. In response to school closures caused by COVID-19, UNESCO recommends the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education. However, in regions where online learning is not feasible, due to a lack of access to distance learning tools such as smart phones and internet connectivity, some parents have resorted to child labor or early marriage as a means to cope with the financial stress placed on them by the pandemic.To aid in slowing the transmission of COVID-19, hundreds of libraries have temporarily closed. In the United States, numerous major cities announced public library closures, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and New York City, affecting 221 libraries. For students without internet at home, this increases the difficulty of keeping up with distance learning.\n\n\n==== Unequal access to educational resources ====\nLack of limitations and exceptions to copyright can also have an impact on the ability of students to access the textbooks and materials they need to study. Several initiatives were taken to grant that students and teachers can have access to open educational resources, or understand copyright limitations. The International Council for Open and Distance Education issued a special website to provide webinars, tips for online teaching and resources for teachers.In New Zealand, a group of publishers agreed to allow for virtual public readings of their materials from libraries and classrooms. A similar agreement took place in Australia, where the Australian Publishers Association, the Australian Library and Information Association and the Australian Society of Authors agreed on a set of exceptional measures to allow libraries to provide educational content. The Australian organization AMCOS agreed to give a gratis license for all their music sheets to all schools across Australia.An advocacy organization in Netherlands launched a website to allow teachers use free-licensed music and video for their classes.A coalition of over 500 civil society organizations and individuals issued a letter to Francis Gurry, Director of the World Intellectual Property Organization, asking, among other things, a special set of limitations and exceptions to copyright for the duration of the pandemic.Several organizations are also working to explain to teachers how to navigate complex copyright scenarios. The National Copyright Unit of Australia, a specialist copyright team responsible for copyright policy and administration for Australian schools and TAFE, issued a set of recommendations to follow on copyright issues while doing remote learning and a set of recommendations for using openly licensed content, specially aimed to parents supporting students.  Centrum Cyfrowe in Poland is holding open calls to support the work of teachers and educators leading in the open education sector. The Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property at the American University is holding a set of webinars for different educators to guide them through copyright issues when delivering online teaching and how to address best practices for fair use.\n\n\n=== Childcare ===\n\nClosures of early childhood education and care (ECEC) as well as schools increases work-family conflicts particularly for parents with younger children who are in more need of care and supervision of distance learning. School closures puts a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school. In the absence of alternative options, working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours, including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse. Alternatively, in some emerging economies, parents may resort to bringing their children to work and engaging them in menial labor, as has been the case in Maharashtra, India, where some out-of-school teenagers have been working in sugar cane fields alongside their day laborer parents.In the United States, as of early April, more than half of existing childcare programs had shut down at least temporarily and were not serving any children.\n\n\n=== Women in the workforce ===\nMany working mothers dropped out of the labor force to take care of their children during school closures and online learning. In places where part-time school attendance or fully virtual learning is implemented, working parents are typically left with a choice of either arranging childcare or to stop working during days when their children are not at school. However, childcare is often difficult to find or unaffordable, due to its increased demand and closures of daycare centers during the pandemic, making it not a viable option for many parents.Due to the difficulty of securing accommodations and flexibility from their employers to allow them to take care of their children, women in the US, particularly Black and Latina women, have lost a disproportionate share of jobs since the beginning of the pandemic. These include forced attritions from women being unable to meet their productivity goals, and voluntary resignations from women who face too much pressure from managing both their paid and unpaid responsibilities. In many cases, women in the workforce were unable to afford private childcare, hence necessitating them to take a leave of absence from work or resigning from their job. A spring 2021 academic study suggested that a much larger proportion of mothers left the workforce in US states where schools offered primarily remote education. Between February 2020 and 2021, more than 2.3 million women in the US have left the labor force. In January 2021, only 57% of American women participated in the labor force, the lowest rate in 33 years.A study from Washington University in St. Louis found that mothers have reduced their paid working hours four to five times more than fathers from February to April 2020, which widened the gender gap in working hours by a maximum of 50%. According to authors of the study, the disparity may lead to droves of women leaving the workforce and massive layoffs for women. Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan, warned that the exodus of women from the workforce during the pandemic may lead to long-term impacts in women's labor market outcomes. Because working hours are a major cause of the gender pay gap, and periods of non-employment has adverse impacts on future earnings and job mobility, expertsr warn that the pandemic-induced reduction can set women's advancement back for decades.\n\n\n=== Nutrition and food insecurity ===\nNutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children. Many children worldwide rely on free or discounted meals at schools. When schools close, nutrition is especially compromised for children in schools where food is provided.In the United States, school lunch programmes are the second-biggest anti-hunger initiative after food stamps. Every year, nearly 30 million children rely on schools to provide free or low-cost meals including breakfast, lunch, snacks, and even dinner. In Washington State, around 45% of the states 1.1 million students enrolled in traditional public and charter schools qualify for subsidised school meals. At least 520,000 students and their families may be affected by food insecurity as a result of school closures. In Alabama, where state-wide school closures as of 18 March have affected over 720,000 students, the state Superintendent announced that staff in schools disproportionately affected by poverty would create meal distribution networks to provide food for students who rely on school lunches.Many families with low income qualify for school lunch programs funded by the federal government and subsidized at the state level.  Due to this need in our society, schools are required to stay open amid the COVID-19 crisis to provide meals to children who qualify for free or reduced rate meals. School have become creative and they send out a weekly survey to reach every student who will need a free or reduced lunch.In the UK, footballer Marcus Rashford pushed the government to extend free school meals over the summer holidays in August. It was voted out at first, by 61 votes. However, in a U-turn, Boris Johnson's government changed it and agreed to carry on paying. Rashford was given an MBE for his efforts.\n\n\n=== Student learning outcomes ===\n\nSchool closures negatively impact student learning outcomes. Schooling provides essential learning and when schools close, children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development. The disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school. When schools close, parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task. This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources.Students gain literacy slower during school closures than in a business-as-usual academic year. It has been estimated that the rate of reading ability gain in kindergarten children in the U.S slows down by 66% during school closures compared to active schooling. A recent study of the effect of the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake found that school closures of an average of 14 weeks has resulted in affected children being 1.5 to 2 years behind their peers who were unaffected by the disaster and its resulting school closures. In practical terms, this learning loss could result in affected children earning 15% less in every adult year of their lives.Student drop-out rates tend to increase as an effect of school closures due to the challenge of ensuring all students return to school once school closures ends. This is especially true of protracted closures. Disadvantaged, at-risk, or homeless children are more likely not to return to school after the closures are ended, and the effect will often be a life-long disadvantage from lost opportunities.Schools are also hubs of social activity and human interaction. When schools are closed, many children and youth miss out on social contact that is essential to learning and development. Accordingly, teachers' perception of student coping significantly decreased with each education level handled, with university instructors finding their students to handle the situation much better than elementary school teachers did.\n\n\n=== Inaccessibility to mitigation strategies ===\n\nThe effect of school closure on academic achievement has been studied in the summer months. Many of the strategies used to prevent academic slump, such as attending summer school, visiting libraries, and/or participating in literacy-rich summer-based activities are not available during the pandemic. Reading every day to a child, an option available while staying at home, reduced the rate of loss by 42%.\n\n\n=== Special education services ===\nPotential impacts of school closures and reliance on distance learning are not addressed in US federal acts of legislation in the early months of the pandemic. Special education students are potentially one of the most impacted groups of COVID-19. Educators continue to focus on implementing strategies to deliver services and accommodations in virtual, hybrid, and in person settings. However, information of how severe they have been affected, and how and if their grades will be affected due to their status and how this would affect their future are currently not specified.\n\n\n=== Effect of school closure on COVID-19 cases and mortality ===\nThe effect of school closure on COVID-19 cases and mortality has been examined in multiple studies. \nIn a study that looked specifically at school closure in the United States, closure of schools was associated with 1.37 million fewer cases and 40,600 fewer deaths from COVID-19 in a six-week study period. However, two international studies examining the impact of reopening schools from kindergarten to grade 12 found no consistent relationship between the reopening of these schools and the spread of COVID-19, with another study from the United States showing no increased risk to childcare workers who continued to work. Other studies that looked at multiple policy changes have shown more modest changes associated with school closure.\n\n\n== Impact on formal education ==\n\nFormal education \u2014 as opposed to informal education or non-formal education \u2014 tends to refer to schools, colleges, universities and training institutions. A 1974 report by the World Bank defined formal education as the following:Formal education: the hierarchically structured, chronologically graded \"education system\", running from primary school through the university and including, in addition to general academic studies, a variety of specialised programmes and institutions for full-time technical and professional training.The majority of data collected on the number of students and learners impacted by COVID-19 has been calculated based on the closure of formal education systems. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics provides figures on students impacted by COVID-19 corresponding to the number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education (ISCED levels 0 to 3), as well as at tertiary education levels (ISCED levels 5 to 8). On average, teachers in K-primary schools were coping worse with the transition than high school educators and university instructors.\n\n\n=== Early childhood education ===\n\nEarly childhood educational programmes are usually designed for children below the age of 3 and may refer to preschools, nursery schools, kindergartens, and some day care programmes. While many primary and secondary schools have closed around the world due to COVID-19, measures impacting early childhood educational programmes have varied. In some countries and territories for instance in Australia preschools and day cares are considered necessary services and have not closed in tandem with broader school closure measures.In the United States, the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families encouraged child care and early learning centres to stay open. Some school districts may offer alternative child care options, prioritising the children of first responders and healthcare workers. The governor of Maryland mandated that specific child care services remain open for the children of emergency personnel while Washington State and California have left it to the discretion of care providers. California Governor Gavin Newsom explained his state's position, saying \"We need our child care facilities, our daycare centers, to operate to absorb the impact of these school closures.\" Colorado has encouraged the development of \"tool kits\" for parents to use at home to emulate the lessons children would have received in their early learning programmes.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe closed all schools throughout the country until 8 April, however, children's daycare facilities were excluded. In early March, five adults associated with a nursing facility for preschool children in Kobe tested positive for coronavirus. After testing over one hundred children at the facility, a preschool student was found to be carrying the virus.\n\n\n=== Primary ===\n\nPrimary or elementary education typically consists of the first four to seven years of formal education. Kindergarten is the first time children participate in formal education. Based on a comparison of longitudinal literacy data in kindergarten-aged students during a spring semester of schooling versus during summer vacation, one study predicted that COVID-19 school closures would slow the rate of literacy ability gain by 66% in kindergarten children in the absence of mitigating alternative educational strategies.  The study estimates that over an 8-month period from 1 January to 1 September 2020, assuming school closures from 16 March to 1 September 2020 (and taking into account the summer vacation that would have still normally taken place during that time), that these kindergarten children would have gained 31% less literacy ability on average than if school closures had not occurred.\n\n\n=== Secondary ===\nSecondary education is in most countries the phase in the education continuum responsible for the development of the young during their adolescence, the most rapid phase of their physical, mental and emotional growth. However, according to many researchers, secondary education students have lost the structure they need in order to thrive in the secondary environment. Instead, students struggle with self-sufficiency and are at risk of falling behind due to distractors in their home and online. The social-emotional wellbeing of secondary students is also of concern with a recent survey citing that 80% of students have experienced some negative impact to their mental health due to the pandemic. 20% say their mental health has significantly worsened. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) suggests that students should get plenty of rest, exercise regularly, and eat well-balanced meals in order to assist in coping with the mental stressors of the pandemic.In the United States, standardized tests for college admissions that are taken near the end of secondary education, such as the SAT and ACT, have adapted to administer in person exams at lower capacity and obeying precautionary measures. Online proctoring has also been explored as a method of making the test more accessible. An online edition of the TOEFL exam is now available for students to take at home. Additionally, many colleges and universities have moved away from requiring standardized tests for admissions, or making the requirement optional.The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) cancelled the examinations for its Diploma Programme and Career-related Programme candidates scheduled between 30 April and 22 May 2020, reportedly affecting more than 200,000 students worldwide. The IBO stated that it would award candidates their diplomas or certificates based on \"their coursework\" and \"the established  assessment expertise, rigor, and quality control already built into the programme.\" College Board has begun offering both in person and online testing for Advanced Placement exams in the 2020\u20132021 school year.\n\n\n=== Private schools in the United States ===\nOne effect of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has come in the form of increases in private school enrollment. Many parents seeking out private school instruction need a place to send their child due to the parents need to work outside of the home. Despite the high cost of private schools, parents find that the tuition cost to be worth it.An unintended consequence of this migration to private schooling is the widening inequality gap between families that can afford private school tuition and those who cannot. These families often have their children at home in virtual learning environments. Issues like poor broadband connection and the inability for parents to properly support their children's learning due to lack of English language skills or work conflicts will see certain students fall behind academically.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools in Kenya ===\nA study on \"teachers' and parents' preparedness to support virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya\" shows that most parents and teachers were not prepared to support virtual learning. This issue affected all schools: public 8-4-4 schools, private 8-4-4 schools, international schools, and private schools in the country. This points to a weak support system for virtual education in Kenyan schools during COVID-19 outbreak affecting virtual learning delivery.\n\n\n=== Grade deflation ===\nHowever, the IBO came under heavy criticism worldwide for their methods in calculating the students' final grades and their \"Enquiry upon results\" (EUR) strategy after results were released on 6 July 2020. Consequently, many students not only received much lower grades than what they were predicted to by their teachers but also missed the entrance requirements to every university they applied to, affecting approximately 170,000 students in 153 countries. As a result, petitions that garnered dozens of thousands of signatures were created online with the hashtag \"IBSCANDAL\" becoming viral, schools and people have lost confidence with the education company and are considering other alternatives for secondary education, and educational reforms are being suggested where students will deviate away from taking significant examinations in the future.\n\n\n=== Higher Education ===\n\nTertiary education, also known as higher education, refers to the non-compulsory educational levels that follow completion of secondary school or high school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training.  Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.\n\n\n==== Undergraduate education ====\n\nUndergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and prior to post-graduate education, for which the learner is typically awarded a bachelor's degree.The closure of colleges and universities has widespread individual, organizational, and learning and teaching implications for students, faculty, administrators, and the institutions themselves. The initial period of rapid adaption during 2020 contained three primary responses to COVID-19: minimal legal response, delayed commencement of study periods, and rapid digitalization of curriculum. Thoughts about what to make of this situation resulted in optional learning online or in person depending on what the university declared as being mandatory.Millions of students are expected to defer the start of their studies for their undergraduate degree to a later year due to the pandemic. This not only will negatively affect the future university intake process due to shortages in places available but universities worldwide are expected to lose billions of USD in equivalent due to the number of students expected to study at university in the 2020\u20132021 academic year.Colleges and universities across the United States have been called upon to issue refunds to students for the cost of tuition and room and board.While $6 billion in emergency relief is to be made available to students during the pandemic, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos decided on 21 April 2020 that it will only be made available to those students who are also already eligible for federal financial aid. This rule will exclude tens of thousands of undocumented students who participate in the government's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA, or \"Dreamers\") program from being able to receive emergency relief funds.Apart from colleges losing vast amounts of income undergraduate students themselves have lost vast amounts of imperative education due to COVID-19. With the lack of regular education amongst all students, learning seems harder to manage. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, college students would have in-person classes, in-person office hours, and in-person extracurricular activities. However, the pandemic has created an atmosphere where students who have an idea about their future occupation, are learning essential information behind a screen. These changes have made focusing on classes built around a students selected major very difficult, as they are not experiencing what they are passionate about to the fullest extent. The result of this is lost passion for specific subjects, the inability to focus on crucial information, and tainted academic integrity all over.\n\n\n===== Impact on local economies =====\nIn the United States of America, colleges and universities operate as \"mini-cities\" which generate significant revenue for cities, states, and regions. For example, Princeton University estimated in 2017 that it contributed $1.58 billion USD per year to the New Jersey economy, and that students spent about $60 million in off-campus spending. College and university closures have a domino effect on economies with far-reaching implications.In March, Linda Bilmes of the Harvard Kennedy School noted that \"local hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops, car rental agencies and other local businesses obtain a significant share of annual revenue from graduation week and college reunions... these communities will suffer a lot of economic damage if the colleges remain closed at that time.\"Small towns which rely on college students to support the local economy and provide labour to local businesses are especially impacted by school closures and the exodus of students from campus. In Ithaca, New York, Cornell University students spent at least $4 million a week in Tompkins County. In the wake of Cornell's decision to keep students home following spring break and transition to virtual instruction, the Mayor of Ithaca called for \"immediate and forceful federal action \u2014 we will see a horrific economic impact as a result of Cornell University closing.\"\n\n\n== Responses to the crisis ==\n\n\n=== UNESCO recommendations ===\n\nUNESCO made ten recommendations for engaging in online learning:\n\nExamine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools: Decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies, internet connectivity, and digital skills of teachers and students. This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.\nEnsure inclusion of the distance learning programmes: Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.\nProtect data privacy and data security: Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students' data privacy.\nPrioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching: Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.\nPlan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes: Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students' knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.\nProvide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools: Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.\nBlend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms: Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.\nDevelop distance learning rules and monitor students' learning process: Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning. Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students' learning process. Try to use tools to support submission of students' feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students' feedback\nDefine the duration of distance learning units based on students' self-regulation skills: Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students' self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes. Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students.\nCreate communities and enhance connection: Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.\n\n\n=== Open Education Community response ===\nOpen Education community members have shared open educational resources (OER) in response to COVID-19, including:\n\nCommonwealth of Learning created the resource \"Keeping the doors of learning open\". The project brings together a curated list of resources for policymakers, school and college administrators, teachers, parents and learners that will assist with student learning during the closure of educational institutions. Most of these are available as OER.\nCommunity Contributed Open Educational Resources for Teaching and Learning in the COVID-19 Era is a co-created spreadsheet of resources. There are multiple tabs on the spreadsheet providing links to: K-12 (primary / secondary) resources, OER repositories, OER toolkits, student support, online teaching, and more.\nOERu online courses is a resource to build capacity in the design and development of OER-enabled online learning. The OERu offers two facilitated online courses including free access to a competency certification in copyright and Creative Commons licensing. These courses will provide skills for participants wanting to design and publish their own online courses using the OERu's open source, component-based digital learning environment.\nTeaching and Learning Online is a website by SkillsCommons and MERLOT that offers a free online resource page in response to COVID-19. This page helps teachers and students prepare to start teaching and learning online.\nThe University of Arizona University Libraries created a \"Library Support for Shifting to Online Teaching\" page and a Free-to-Use Course Materials webinar.\nWirLernenOnline is a German online platform to find learning material for digital lessons in primary school, secondary school, upper secondary and vocational education.\n\n\n== Online learning platforms ==\n\n\n=== Coursera ===\nWith schools closed, demand for online education platforms has increased. Coursera, which can be taught online, also grew significantly during the pandemic.\nCoursera saw 59% revenue growth year over year, largely due to a pandemic-induced boom in digital learning.\nTotal registered users in 2020 grew 65% over 2019.\nDuring the pandemic, Coursera also has partnered with more than 330 government agencies across 70 countries and 30 US states and cities as part of the Coursera Workforce Recovery Initiative, which helps governments offer unemployed workers free access to thousands of courses for business, technology and data science skills from companies including Amazon and Google.\n\n\n== Vaccination ==\n\nSome universities, like the University of Virginia, require students to be vaccinated for the 2021\u20132022 academic year. The University of Virginia began reminding unvaccinated students of this rule on May 20, 2021. Three months later, it disenrolled students who had not yet been vaccinated, including 49 students who had already been enrolled in classes for the Fall 2021 semester.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCOVID-19 at the University of Notre Dame\nDigital divide\nHomeschooling during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on science and technology\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on religion\nDistance education in Chicago Public Schools in 1937\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n This article incorporates text from a free content work.

During one of his investigations, he is attacked and forced to take an experimental poison by a member of the Black Organization. However, due to a rare side-effect, he shrinks to the form of a young child.[ch. 1] In order to keep his true identity a secret, he now goes under the alias Conan Edogawa (\u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd \u30b3\u30ca\u30f3, Edogawa Konan) and pretends to be a real child to throw off suspicion while he secretly solves many cases and looks for clues about the organization.[ch. 2] He loves his childhood friend Rachel Moore, but cannot confess his feelings or reveal his true identity in order to protect her. His two Japanese voice actors are Kappei Yamaguchi for Jimmy and Minami Takayama for Conan.

She loves Jimmy but is afraid to admit her feelings, and denies their relationship is romantic whenever the conversation is brought up. She often worries for his safety and waits for his return. As captain of the karate team and a regional champion, she is able to fend for herself physically against attackers, but is still squeamish when it comes to films and shows in the horror genre.[ch. 1] She is also skilled in Karate, similarly to her father who is skilled in Judo. She is very kind and helps anyone in need, even if that person is a potential criminal. In one instance, her kindness to Vermouth prompts the latter to keep Jimmy's identity a secret from the Black Organization. Like Jimmy, she dislikes the idea of killing anyone, including criminals, as she believes criminals should face punishment through the justice system. The Junior Detective League views her as a role model and the kids often turns to her for advice. She is skilled in house chores, including sewing, knitting, and cooking, and has very good fortune in games of chance, hardly ever losing in games such as mahjong. She spends most of her home life looking after Conan and her father, and hopes that her father and mother can reconcile their separation.

Due to Conan often knocking him unconscious and impersonating his voice to solve cases, Richard has become well known as a skilled detective. He and Conan share a rivalry to some extent and is an egotist at times, taking credit in cases that he didn't really solve that Conan already had when they are together. Because he appears to be tired or sleeping when solving a case, he is often referred to as \"Sleeping Moore\" (\u7720\u308a\u306e\u5c0f\u4e94\u90ce, Nemuri no Kogor\u014d, lit. \"Sleeping Kogoro\").[ch. 119] Before becoming a private detective, he worked as a police officer under Inspector Meguire.[ch. 7] He is married to Eva Kaden, a successful lawyer and childhood friend, but they have been separated for over ten years due to their constant arguing.[ch. 107] He reveals that on many occasions he still loves her and has attempted to reconcile their relationship.[ch. 266] Despite his irresponsible habits of drinking, gambling, and flirting with young women, he cares deeply for his daughter and at times displays his sense of honor and strict ethics.

                "title": "Canadian Indian residential school system",
                "summary": "In Canada, the Indian residential school system was a network of boarding schools for Indigenous peoples. Attendance was mandatory from 1894 to 1947. The network was funded by the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs and administered by Christian churches. The school system was created to isolate Indigenous children from the influence of their own native culture and religion in order to assimilate them into the dominant Canadian culture.:\u200a42\u200a Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year existence, around 150,000 children were placed in residential schools nationally.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a By the 1930s about 30 percent of Indigenous children were believed to be attending residential schools. The number of school-related deaths remains unknown due to incomplete records. Estimates range from 3,200 to over 30,000.The system had its origins in laws enacted before Confederation, but it was primarily active from the passage of the Indian Act in 1876, under Prime Minister Alexander MacKenzie. Under Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, the government adopted the residential industrial school system of the United States, a partnership between the government and various church organizations. An amendment to the Indian Act in 1894, under Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell, made attendance at day schools, industrial schools, or residential schools compulsory for First Nations children. Due to the remote nature of many communities, school locations meant that for some families, residential schools were the only way to comply. The schools were intentionally located at substantial distances from Indigenous communities to minimize contact between families and their children. Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed argued for schools at greater distances to reduce family visits, which he thought counteracted efforts to assimilate Indigenous children. Parental visits were further restricted by the use of a pass system designed to confine Indigenous peoples to reserves. The last federally-funded residential school, Kivalliq Hall in Rankin Inlet, closed in 1997. Schools operated in every province and territory with the exception of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\nThe residential school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing them from their families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, and exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse. Students were also subjected to forced enfranchisement as \"assimilated\" citizens that removed their legal identity as Indians. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the residential school system often graduated being unable to fit into their communities but remaining subject to racist attitudes in mainstream Canadian society. The system ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system has been linked to an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, suicide, and intergenerational trauma which persist within Indigenous communities today.While religious communities issued their first apologies for their respective roles in the residential school system in the late 1980s and early 1990s, on June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered the first public apology on behalf of the Government of Canada and the leaders of the other federal parties in the House of Commons. Nine days prior, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered about 7,000 statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. The TRC report concluded that the school system amounted to cultural genocide. In 2021, thousands of unmarked graves were discovered on the grounds of former residential schools, and are continuing to be searched.",

Schools operated in every province and territory with the exception of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\nThe residential school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing them from their families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, and exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse. Students were also subjected to forced enfranchisement as \"assimilated\" citizens that removed their legal identity as Indians. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the residential school system often graduated being unable to fit into their communities but remaining subject to racist attitudes in mainstream Canadian society. The system ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system has been linked to an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, suicide, and intergenerational trauma which persist within Indigenous communities today.While religious communities issued their first apologies for their respective roles in the residential school system in the late 1980s and early 1990s, on June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered the first public apology on behalf of the Government of Canada and the leaders of the other federal parties in the House of Commons. Nine days prior, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered about 7,000 statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. The TRC report concluded that the school system amounted to cultural genocide. In 2021, thousands of unmarked graves were discovered on the grounds of former residential schools, and are continuing to be searched.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAttempts to assimilate Indigenous peoples were rooted in imperial colonialism centred around European worldviews and cultural practices, and a concept of land ownership based on the discovery doctrine.:\u200a47\u201350\u200a As explained in the executive summary of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's (TRC) final report: \"Underlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization to savage people who could never civilize themselves ... a belief of racial and cultural superiority.\":\u200a50\u200aAssimilation efforts began as early as the 17th century with the arrival of French missionaries in New France. They were resisted by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the R\u00e9collets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also played a role in the decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.:\u200a3\u200a:\u200a58\u201360\u200aEducational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, prior to the introduction of state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba.:\u200a50\u200a Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in what is now the province of Ontario, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.\n\nAlthough many of these early schools were open for only a short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest continuously operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.The renewed interest in residential schools in the early 1800s can be linked to the decline in military hostility faced by the settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement.:\u200a3\u200a This change was also associated with the transfer of responsibility for interactions with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.:\u200a73\u20135\u200aBeginning in the late 1800s, the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) officially encouraged the growth of the residential school system as a valuable component in a wider policy of integrating Indigenous people into European-Canadian society. The TRC found that the schools, and the removal of children from their families, amounted to cultural genocide, a conclusion that echoed the words of historian John S. Milloy, who argued that the system's aim was to \"kill the Indian in the child.\":\u200a42\u200a Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year existence, around 150,000 children were placed in residential schools nationally.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a As the system was designed as an immersion program, Indigenous children were in many schools prohibited from, and sometimes punished for, speaking their own languages or practising their own faiths. The primary stated goal was to convert Indigenous children to Christianity and acculturate them.\n\nMany of the government-funded residential schools were run by churches of various denominations. Between 1867 and 1939, the number of schools operating at one time peaked at 80 in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were operated by 16 Catholic dioceses and about three dozen Catholic communities; 21 were operated by the Church of England / Anglican Church of Canada; 13 were operated by the United Church of Canada, and 2 were operated by Presbyterians.:\u200a682\u200a The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed by the federal government for economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning. As a result, the number of schools per denomination was less a reflection of their presence in the general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.:\u200a683\u200a\n\n\n=== Government involvement ===\nAlthough education in Canada was made the jurisdiction of the provincial governments by the British North America Act, Indigenous peoples and their treaties were under the jurisdiction of the federal government. As a condition of several treaties, the federal government agreed to provide for Indigenous education. Residential schools were funded under the Indian Act by what was then the federal Department of the Interior. Adopted in 1876 as An Act to amend and consolidate the laws respecting Indians, it consolidated all previous laws placing Indigenous communities, land and finances under federal control. As explained by the TRC, the act \"made Indians wards of the state, unable to vote in provincial or federal elections or enter the professions if they did not surrender their status, and severely limited their freedom to participate in spiritual and cultural practices.\":\u200a110\u200a\n\nThe report commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, titled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada :\u200a12\u201317\u200a and referred to as the Bagot Report, is seen as the foundational document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada.:\u200a15\u200aOn May 26, 1847, Ryerson wrote a letter for George Vardon, Assistant Superintendent of Indian Affairs, asserting that \"the North American Indian cannot be civilized or preserved in a state of civilization (including habits of industry and sobriety) except in connection with, if not by the influence of, not only religious instruction and sentiment but of religious feelings\".:\u200a3\u200a He expressly recommended that Indigenous students be educated in a separate, denominational, English-only system with a focus on industrial training. This letter was published in 1898 as an appendix to a larger report entitled Statistics Respecting Indian Schools.The Gradual Civilization Act of 1857 and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869 formed the foundations for this system prior to Confederation. These acts assumed the inherent superiority of French and British ways, and the need for Indigenous peoples to become French or English speakers, Christians, and farmers. At the time, many Indigenous leaders argued to have these acts overturned. The Gradual Civilization Act awarded 50 acres (200,000 m2) of land to any Indigenous male deemed \"sufficiently advanced in the elementary branches of education\" and would automatically enfranchise him, removing any tribal affiliation or treaty rights.:\u200a18\u200a With this legislation, and through the creation of residential schools, the government believed Indigenous peoples could eventually become assimilated into the general population. Individual allotments of farmland would require changes in the communal reserve system, something fiercely opposed by First Nations governments.:\u200a18\u201319\u200aIn January 1879, John A. Macdonald, Prime Minister of what was then post-Confederation Canada, commissioned politician Nicholas Flood Davin to write a report regarding the industrial boarding-school system in the United States.:\u200a154\u200a Now known as the Davin Report, the Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds was submitted to Ottawa on March 14, 1879, and made the case for a cooperative approach between the Canadian government and the church to implement the assimilation pursued by President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant.:\u200a1\u200a Davin's report relied heavily on findings he acquired through consultations with government officials and representatives of the Five Civilized Tribes in Washington, DC, and church officials in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He visited only one industrial day school, in Minnesota, before submitting his findings.:\u200a154\u20138\u200a In his report Davin concluded that the best way to assimilate Indigenous peoples was to start with children in a residential setting, away from their families.:\u200a157\u200a:\u200a12\u200aDavin's findings were supported by Vital-Justin Grandin, who felt that while the likelihood of civilizing adults was low, there was hope when it came to Indigenous children. He explained in a letter to Public Works Minister Hector-Louis Langevin that the best course of action would be to make children \"lead a life different from their parents and cause them to forget the customs, habits & language of their ancestors.\":\u200a159\u200a In 1883 Parliament approved $43,000 for three industrial schools and the first, Battleford Industrial School, opened on December 1 of that year. By 1900, there were 61 schools in operation.:\u200a161\u200aThe government began purchasing church-run boarding schools in the 1920s. During this period capital costs associated with the schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated due to the lack of written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.:\u200a240\u200aBy the 1930s government officials recognized that the residential school system was financially unsustainable and failing to meet the intended goal of training and assimilating Indigenous children into European-Canadian society. Robert Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training in the Indian Affairs Branch of the federal Department of Mines and Resources, opposed the expansion of new schools, noting in 1936 that \"to build educational institutions, particularly residential schools, while the money at our disposal is insufficient to keep the schools already erected in a proper state of repair, is, to me, very unsound and a practice difficult to justify.\":\u200a3\u200a He proposed the expansion of day schools, an approach to educating Indigenous children that he would continue to pursue after being promoted to director of the welfare and training branch in 1945. The proposal was resisted by the United Church, the Anglican Church, and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, who believed that the solution to the system's failure was not restructuring but intensification.:\u200a3\u20135\u200aBetween 1945 and 1955, the number of First Nations students in day schools run by Indian Affairs expanded from 9,532 to 17,947. This growth in student population was accompanied by an amendment to the Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes marked the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools.:\u200a71\u200a It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education as a result of their transition into the public school system.Despite the shift in policy from educational assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued through much of the 1960s and 70s.:\u200a147\u200a The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of section 88 of the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.:\u200a182\u200aIn 1969, after years of sharing power with churches, the DIA took sole control of the residential school system.:\u200a79\u201384\u200a The last federally-funded residential school, Kivalliq Hall in Rankin Inlet, closed in 1997. Residential schools operated in every Canadian province and territory with the exception of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. It is estimated that the number of residential schools reached its peak in the early 1930s with 80 schools and more than 17,000 enrolled students. About 150,000 children are believed to have attended a residential school over the course of the system's existence.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a\n\n\n=== Parental resistance and compulsory attendance ===\n\nThe parents and families of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including the increase of centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements to the quality of education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.:\u200a669\u2013674\u200aIn 1894, amendments to the Indian Act made school attendance compulsory for Indigenous children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, the health of the children and their prior completion of school examinations.:\u200a254\u2013255\u200a It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908.:\u200a261\u200a The introduction of mandatory attendance was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. Reliant on student enrolment quotas to secure funding, they were struggling to attract new students due to increasingly poor school conditions.:\u200a128\u200aCompulsory attendance ended in 1948, following the 1947 report of a special joint committee and subsequent amendment of the Indian Act. Government officials were still able to influence student attendance. The introduction of the Family Allowance Act in 1945 stipulated that school-aged children had to be enroled in school for families to qualify for the \"baby bonus\", further coercing Indigenous parents into having their children attend.:\u200a170\u200a\n\n\n== Conditions ==\n\nStudents in the residential school system were faced with a multitude of abuses by teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline that would not have been tolerated in any other Canadian school system.:\u200a14\u200a Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls or punish and deter runaways \u2013 whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69 percent. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves \u2013 overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.:\u200a83\u201389\u200aUntil the late 1950s, when the federal government shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisanal skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and kept some students undernourished as the control sample.Details of the mistreatment of students were published numerous times throughout the 20th century by government officials reporting on school conditions, and in the proceedings of civil cases brought forward by survivors seeking compensation for the abuse they endured. The conditions and impact of residential schools were also brought to light in popular culture as early as 1967, with the publication of \"The Lonely Death of Chanie Wenjack\" by Ian Adams in Maclean's and the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67. In the 1990s, investigations and memoirs by former students revealed that many students at residential schools were subjected to severe physical, psychological, and sexual abuse by school staff members and by older students. Among the former students to come forward was Phil Fontaine, then Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, who in October 1990 publicly discussed the abuse he and others suffered while attending Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.:\u200a129\u2013130\u200aAfter the government closed most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater awareness by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities to draw attention to the residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.:\u200a551\u2013554\u200a\n\n\n=== Funding ===\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission list three reasons behind the federal government's decision to establish residential schools.\n\nProvide Aboriginal people with skills to participate in a market-based economy.\nFurther political assimilation, in hope that educated students would give up their status and not return to their reserves or families.\nSchools were \"engines of cultural and spiritual change\" where \"'savages' were to emerge as Christian 'white men'\".:\u200a29\u200aIn addition to these three the Commission stated a national security element and quoted Andsell Macrae, a commissioner with Indian Affairs: \"it is unlikely that any Tribe or Tribes would give trouble of a serious nature to the Government whose members had children completely under Government control.\":\u200a29\u200a\n\nThe federal government sought to cut costs by adopting the residential industrial school system of the United States. Indian Commissioner Edgar Dewdney aspired to have the residential schools, through forced labour, be financially independent a few years after opening. The government believed through the industrial system and cheap labour costs of missionary staff it could \"operate a residential school system on a nearly cost-free basis.\":\u200a30\u201331\u200a Students \"were expected to raise or grow and prepare most of the food they ate, to make and repair much of their clothing, and to maintain the schools.\" Most schools did this through a system where students studied for half the day and did \"vocational training\" for the other half.:\u200a48\u200a This system failed and the schools never became self-supporting.:\u200a30\u200aBy 1891, the government cut already low salaries, stopped covering operating costs, and implemented a fixed amount of funding per student. This policy drove competition and encouraged the admission of students that were deemed \"too young or too sick.\" The chronic underfunding developed a health crisis within the schools and a financial crisis within the missionary groups. In 1911, in an attempt to alleviate the health crisis the federal government increased per capita grant funding. However, the funding did not adjust for inflation. In the 1930s, throughout the Great Depression, and World War II that grant was repeatedly reduced. In 1937, the per capita grant averaged $180 per student per year. For perspective, per-capita costs for comparable institutions included: Manitoba School for the Deaf $642, Manitoba School for Boys $550, U.S. Chilocco Indian Agricultural School $350. The Child Welfare League of America stated per capita costs for \"well-run institutions\" ranged between $313 and $541, Canada was paying 57.5% of the minimum figure. Changes in per capita costs did not occur until the 1950s and were seen as insignificant. In 1966, Saskatchewan residential schools per capita costs ranged from $694 and $1,193, which is 7%\u201336% of what other Canadian child-welfare institutions were paying ($3,300 and $9,855) and 5%\u201325% of what U.S. residential care was paying ($4,500 and $14,059.):\u200a30\u201331\u200aGovernment officials believed that since many staff members belonged to religious orders with vows of poverty or missionary organizations, pay was relatively unimportant. Thus almost all staff were poorly paid and schools had trouble recruiting and retaining staff. In 1948, C.H. Birdsall, chair of the United Church committee responsible for the Edmonton school, in regard to the lack of funding for salaries, accommodations, and equipment, stated that it was \"doubtful the present work with Indian Children could properly be called education.\" In 1948, Sechelt school staff were paying full-time staff a salary of $1800. In the 1960s, Christie school staff were paid $50 a month.:\u200a92\u200aThe per capita grant system severely decreased the education quality. British Columbia Indian Superintendent Arthur Wellesley Vowell in response to one of his agents recommending they only approve qualified teaching staff stated that that would require more funding and that Indian Affairs did not \"entertain requests for increased grants to Indian boarding and industrial schools.\" The pay was so low relative to provincial schools that many of the teachers lacked any teaching qualifications.:\u200a44\u200aFederal cuts to funding during the Great Depression resulted in students paying the price. By 1937, at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, milk production among the schools dairy herds was reduced by 50%. The federal government refused to fund construction for an additional barn to increase milk production and isolate the sick animals. Even among other schools dairy herds, funding was so low that milk was separated with \"skimmed milk served to the children\" and the fat turned to dairy products sold to fund the schools. In 1939, the Presbyterian school in Kenora began charging students 10 cents a loaf until their Indian agent ordered the school to stop.:\u200a57\u201358\u200a\n\n\n=== Family visitation ===\nParents and family members regularly travelled to the schools, often camping outside to be closer to their children. So many parents made the trip that Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed argued that the schools should be moved farther from the reserves to make visiting more difficult.:\u200a601\u2013604\u200a He also objected to allowing children to return home during school breaks and holidays because he believed the trips interrupted their assimilation.Visitation, for those who could make the journey, was strictly controlled by school officials in a manner similar to the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases schools denied parents access to their children altogether. Others required families to meet with them in the presence of school officials and speak only in English; parents who could not speak in English were unable to talk to their children. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed, without legislative authority to do so, the pass system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves.:\u200a601\u2013604\u200a Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.\n\n\n=== Instruction style and outcomes ===\n Instruction provided to students was rooted in an institutional and European approach to education. It differed dramatically from child rearing in traditional knowledge systems based on 'look, listen, and learn' models. Corporal punishment and loss of privileges characterized the residential school system, while traditional Indigenous approaches to education favour positive guidance toward desired behaviour through game-based play, story-telling, and formal ritualized ceremonies.:\u200a15\u201321\u200a While at school, many children had no contact with their families for up to 10 months at a time, and in some cases had no contact for years. The impact of the disconnect from their families was furthered by students being discouraged or prohibited from speaking Indigenous languages, even among themselves and outside the classroom, so that English or French would be learned and their own languages forgotten. In some schools, they were subject to physical violence for speaking their own languages or for practicing non-Christian faiths.Most schools operated with the stated goal of providing students with the vocational training and social skills required to obtain employment and integrate into Canadian society after graduation. In actuality, these goals were poorly and inconsistently achieved. Many graduates were unable to land a job due to poor educational training. Returning home was equally challenging due to an unfamiliarity with their culture and, in some cases, an inability to communicate with family members using their traditional language. Instead of intellectual achievement and advancement, it was often physical appearance and dress, like that of middle class, urban teenagers, or the promotion of a Christian ethic, that was used as a sign of successful assimilation. There was no indication that school attendees achieved greater financial success than those who did not go to school. As the father of a pupil who attended Battleford Industrial School, in Saskatchewan, for five years explained: \"he cannot read, speak or write English, nearly all his time having been devoted to herding and caring for cattle instead of learning a trade or being otherwise educated. Such employment he can get at home.\":\u200a164\u2013172,\u200a194\u2013199\u200a\n\n\n=== Experimentation ===\nBoth academic research and the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee relay evidence that students were included in several scientific research experiments without their knowledge, their consent or the consent of their parents. These experiments include nutrition experiments which involved intentional malnourishment of children, vaccine trials for the BCG vaccine, as well as studies on extrasensory perception, vitamin D diet supplements, amebicides, isoniazid, hemoglobin, bedwetting, and dermatoglyphics.\n\n\n== Mortality rates ==\n\nResidential school deaths were common and have been linked to poorly constructed and maintained facilities.:\u200a92\u2013101\u200a The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records.:\u200a92\u201393\u200a Research by the TRC revealed that at least 3,201 students had died, mostly from disease.:\u200a92\u200a TRC chair Justice Murray Sinclair has suggested that the number of deaths may exceed 6,000. The vast majority of deaths occurred before the 1950s.\n\nThe 1906 Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs, submitted by chief medical officer Peter Bryce, highlighted that the \"Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times\".:\u200a97\u201398\u200a:\u200a275\u200a Among the list of causes he noted the infectious disease of tuberculosis and the role residential schools played in spreading the disease by way of poor ventilation and medical screening.:\u200a97\u201398\u200a:\u200a275\u2013276\u200a\n\nIn 1907, Bryce reported on the conditions of Manitoba and North-West residential schools: \"we have created a situation so dangerous to health that I was often surprised that the results were not even worse than they have been shown statistically to be.\":\u200a18\u200a In 1909, Bryce reported that, between 1894 and 1908, mortality rates at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30 to 60 per cent over five years (that is, five years after entry, 30 to 60 per cent of students had died, or 6 to 12 per cent per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates could have been avoided if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.:\u200a381\u200a\n\nIn 1920 and 1922, Regina physician F. A. Corbett was commissioned to visit the schools in the west of the country, and found similar results to those reported by Bryce. At the Ermineskin school in Hobbema, Alberta, he found that 50 percent of the children had tuberculosis.:\u200a98\u200a At Sarcee Boarding School near Calgary, he noted that all 33 students were \"much below even a passable standard of health\" and \"[a]ll but four were infected with tuberculosis\".:\u200a99\u200a In one classroom, he found 16 ill children, many near death, who were being forced to sit through lessons.:\u200a99\u200aIn 2011, reflecting on the TRC's research, Justice Murray Sinclair told the Toronto Star: \"Missing children \u2013 that is the big surprise for me ... That such large numbers of children died at the schools. That the information of their deaths was not communicated back to their families.\"\n\n\n=== Missing children and unmarked graves ===\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission wrote that the policy of Indian Affairs was to refuse to return the bodies of children home due to the associated expense, and to instead require the schools to bear the cost of burials.:\u200a70\u200a The TRC concluded that it may be impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, in part because of the practice of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.The fourth volume of the TRC's final report, dedicated to missing children and unmarked burials, was developed after the original TRC members realized, in 2007, that the issue required its own working group. In 2009, the TRC requested $1.5 million in extra funding from the federal government to complete this work, but was denied. The researchers concluded, after searching land near schools using satellite imagery and maps, that, \"for the most part, the cemeteries that the Commission documented are abandoned, disused, and vulnerable to accidental disturbance\".:\u200a1\u200aIn May 2021, remains believed to be those of 215 children were found buried on the site of the Kamloops Indian Residential School in Kamloops, British Columbia, on the lands of the Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation. The remains were located with the assistance of a ground-penetrating radar specialist and Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc Chief Rosanne Casimir wrote that the deaths were believed to have been undocumented and that work was underway to determine if related records were held at the Royal British Columbia Museum.\nOn June 23, 2021, an estimated 751 unmarked graves were found on the site of Marieval Indian Residential School in Marieval, Saskatchewan, on the lands of Cowessess First Nation. Some of these graves predated the establishment of the residential school. On June 24, 2021, Chief Cadmus Delorme of the Cowessess First Nation held a virtual press conference. From June 2 to 23 they found an estimated 751 unmarked graves. Delorme went on to state:This is not a mass grave site, these are unmarked graves...in 1960, there may have been marks on these graves. The Catholic Church representatives removed these headstones and today they are unmarked graves... the machine has a 10 to 15 percent error...we do know there is at least 600... We cannot affirm that they are all children, but there are oral stories that there are adults in this gravesite... some may have went to the Church and from our local towns and they could have been buried here as well... We are going to put names on these unmarked graves.On June 30, 2021, the Lower Kootenay Band reported the discovery of 182 unmarked graves near St. Eugene's Mission School near Cranbrook, British Columbia.\n\n\n== Self-governance and school closure ==\n\nWhen the government revised the Indian Act in the 1940s and 1950s, some bands, along with regional and national Indigenous organizations, wanted to maintain schools in their communities. Motivations for support of the schools included their role as a social service in communities that were suffering from extensive family breakdowns; the significance of the schools as employers; and the inadequacy of other opportunities for children to receive education.\n\nIn the 1960s, a major confrontation took place at the Saddle Lake Reserve in Alberta. After several years of deteriorating conditions and administrative changes, parents protested against the lack of transparency at the Blue Quills Indian School in 1969. In response, the government decided to close the school, convert the building into a residence, and enrol students in a public school 5 kilometres (3 mi) away in St. Paul, Alberta.:\u200a84\u200a The TRC report pertaining to this period states:\n\nFearing their children would face racial discrimination in St. Paul, parents wished to see the school transferred to a private society that would operate it both as a school and a residence. The federal government had been open to such a transfer if the First Nations organization was structured as a provincial school division. The First Nations rejected this, saying that a transfer of First Nations education to the provincial authority was a violation of Treaty rights.:\u200a84\u200a\nIn the summer of 1970, members of the Saddle Lake Cree Nation occupied the building and demanded the right to run it themselves. More than 1,000 people participated in the 17-day sit-in, which lasted from July 14 to 31.:\u200a89\u201390\u200a Their efforts resulted in Blue Quills becoming the first Indigenous-administered school in the country. It continues to operate today as University nuhelot\u02bc\u012fne thaiyots\u02bc\u012f nistameyim\u00e2kanak Blue Quills, the first Indigenous-governed university in Canada. Following the success of the Blue Quills effort the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) released the 1972 paper Indian Control of Indian Education that responded, in part, to the Canadian Government's 1969 White Paper calling for the abolishment of the land treaties and the Indian Act. The NIB paper underscored the right of Indigenous communities to locally direct how their children are educated and served as the integral reference for education policy moving forward.\nFew other former residential schools have converted to independently operated community schools for Indigenous children. White Calf Collegiate in Lebret, Saskatchewan, was run by the Star Blanket Cree Nation from 1973 until its closure in 1998, after being run by the Oblates from 1884 to 1969. Old Sun Community College is run by the Siksika Nation in Alberta in a building designed by architect Roland Guerney Orr. From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun residential school, first run by the Anglicans and taken over by the federal government in 1969. It was converted to adult learning and stood as a campus of Mount Royal College from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations. In 1988, the Old Sun College Act was passed in the Alberta Legislature recognizing Old Sun Community College as a First Nations College.\n\n\n== Lasting effects ==\nSurvivors of residential schools and their families have been found to suffer from historical trauma with a lasting and adverse effect on the transmission of Indigenous culture between generations. A 2010 study led by Gwen Reimer explained historic trauma, passed on intergenerationally, as the process through which \"cumulative stress and grief experienced by Aboriginal communities is translated into a collective experience of cultural disruption and a collective memory of powerlessness and loss\".:\u200ax\u200a This trauma has been used to explain the persistent negative social and cultural impacts of colonial rule and residential schools, including the prevalence of sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, lateral violence, mental illness and suicide among Indigenous peoples.:\u200a10\u201311\u200aThe 2012 national report of the First Nations Regional Health Study found that respondents who attended residential schools were more likely than those who did not to have been diagnosed with at least one chronic medical condition. A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65 per cent have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder; 21 per cent have been diagnosed with major depression; 7 percent have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder; and 7 percent have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.In a 2014 article, Anishinaabe psychiatry researcher Amy Bombay reviewed research that relates to the intergenerational effects. She found that, \"In addition to negative effects observed among those who attended IRS, accumulating evidence suggests that the children of those who attended (IRS offspring) are also at greater risk for poor well-being.\" 37.2% of adults with at least one parent who attended a boarding school contemplated committing suicide in their lifetimes, compared to 25.7% of people whose parents did not attend residential boarding schools. Higher levels of depression symptoms and psychological trauma were evident among Indian residential school survivors' children.\n\n\n=== Loss of language and culture ===\nAlthough some schools permitted students to speak their Indigenous languages, suppressing their languages and culture was a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. The schools strictly prohibited the use of these languages even though many students spoke little to no English or French. Traditional and spiritual activities including the potlatch and Sun Dance were also banned. Some survivors reported being strapped or forced to eat soap when they were caught speaking their own language. The inability to communicate was further affected by their families' inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors felt ashamed of being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities as ugly and dirty.:\u200a4,\u200a83\u201387\u200a Survivors also have to deal with the effects of cultural linguicide, which is defined as loss of language which eventually leads to loss of culture.The stigma the residential school system created against elders passing Indigenous culture on to younger generations has been linked to the over-representation of Indigenous languages on the list of endangered languages in Canada. The TRC noted that most of the 90 Indigenous languages that still exist are at risk of disappearing, with great-grandparents as the only speakers of many such languages.:\u200a154\u200a \nIt concluded that a failure of governments and Indigenous communities to prioritize the teaching and preservation of traditional languages ensured that despite the closure of residential schools, the eradication of Indigenous culture desired by government officials and administrators would inevitably be fulfilled \"through a process of systematic neglect\".:\u200a155\u200a In addition to the forceful eradication of elements of Indigenous culture, the schools trained students in the patriarchal dichotomies then common in British and Canadian society and useful to state institutions, such as the domesticization of female students through imbuing 'stay-at-home' values and the militarization of male students through soldierlike regimentation.  \nHowever, Indigenous children in boarding schools were not deterred, and continued to speak and practice their language in an attempt to keep it alive. Assistant Professor in Professional Communication, Jane Griffith, said, \"Predictably, nineteenth-century government texts do not reveal the strategies Indigenous peoples had for maintaining their languages in the same way Indian boarding school survivor memoir, literature, and testimony do from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This absence may exemplify how school newspapers carefully created an English-only fantasy for readers, but may also attest to the success of students' secrecy: perhaps official school documents did not report that students still knew Indigenous languages because schools were unaware of this. Government reports, if read contrapuntally, were more forthcoming in how students continued to speak their language, though they framed such resistance as failure.\"\n\n\n=== Native resistance ===\nBoarding schools in Canada worked towards assimilation of Native students. Historians Brian Klopotek and Brenda Child explain,\u201cEducation for Indians was not mandatory in Canada until 1920, long after compulsory attendance laws were passed in the United States, although families frequently resisted sending their children to the residential schools. Many protested the lack of decent educational opportunities available, but the government took little action until after World War I, when European-Canadians first began to acknowledge discriminatory treatment towards Indians.\u201d Indigenous resistance is defined, in the words of Anishinaabe scholar-artist Leanne Simpson as \u201ca radical and complete overturning of the nation-state's political formations.\u201d  During this time Native people found ways to resist this colonial endeavor.\nThose that survived used their knowledge to speak back against colonialism, as historians Brian Klopotek and Brenda Child explain, \u201cIn Canada, the results of this system were more complicated than the government anticipated. Often students returned to their reserves to become leaders, while others entered the labor market and competed with Euro-American workers.\u201d The Canadian government was displeased with this, \u201cAs one minister for Indian Affairs noted in 1897, \"we are educating these Indians to compete industrially with our own peoples, which seems to me a very undesirable amount of public money.\" The government, perceiving Indian education as too generous, reduced the services available to First Nations peoples beginning in 1910 and emphasized low cost schooling thereafter.\u201d \n\n\n== Apologies ==\nAcknowledgment of the wrongs done by the residential school system began in the 1980s.\n\n\n=== United Church of Canada ===\nIn 1986, the first apology for residential schools by any institution in Canada was from the United Church of Canada in Sudbury, Ontario. At the 1986 31st General Council, the United Church of Canada responded to the request of Indigenous peoples that it apologize to them for its part in colonization and adopted the apology. Rev. Bob Smith stated:We imposed our civilization as a condition of accepting the gospel. We tried to make you be like us and in so doing we helped to destroy the vision that made you what you were. As a result, you, and we, are poorer and the image of the Creator in us is twisted, blurred, and we are not what we are meant by God to be. We ask you to forgive us and to walk together with us in the Spirit of Christ so that our peoples may be blessed and God's creation healed. The elders present at the General Council expressly refused to accept the apology and chose to receive the apology, believing further work needed to be done.\nIn 1998, the church apologized expressly for the role it played in the residential school system. On behalf of The United Church of Canada the Right Rev. Bill Phipps stated:I apologize for the pain and suffering that our church's involvement in the Indian Residential School system has caused. We are aware of some of the damage that this cruel and ill-conceived system of assimilation has perpetrated on Canada's First Nations peoples. For this we are truly and most humbly sorry... To those individuals who were physically, sexually, and mentally abused as students of the Indian Residential Schools in which The United Church of Canada was involved, I offer you our most sincere apology. You did nothing wrong. You were and are the victims of evil acts that cannot under any circumstances be justified or excused... We are in the midst of a long and painful journey as we reflect on the cries that we did not or would not hear, and how we have behaved as a church...we commit ourselves to work toward ensuring that we will never again use our power as a church to hurt others with attitudes of racial and spiritual superiority. We pray that you will hear the sincerity of our words today and that you will witness the living out of our apology in our actions in the future.\n\n\n=== Roman Catholic Church ===\n\nIn 1991, at the National Meeting on Indian Residential Schools in Saskatoon, Canadian Bishops and leaders of religious orders that participated in the schools issued an apology stating: We are sorry and deeply regret the pain, suffering and alienation that so many experienced. We have heard their cries of distress, feel their anguish and want to be part of the healing process...we pledge solidarity with the aboriginal peoples in their pursuit of recognition of their basic human rights... urge the federal government to assume its responsibility for its part in the Indian Residential Schools... (and) urge our faith communities to become better informed and more involved in issues important to aboriginal peoples\nIn July 1991, Douglas Crosby, then presidential of the Oblate of Canada, the missionary religious congregation that operated a majority of the Catholic residential schools in Canada, apologized on behalf of 1,200 Oblates then living in Canada, to approximately 25,000 Indigenous people at Lac Ste. Anne, Alberta, stating:We apologize for the part we played in the cultural, ethnical, linguistic and religious imperialism that was part of the European mentality and, in a particular way, for the instances of physical and sexual abuse that occurred in these schools...For these trespasses we wish to voice today our deepest sorrow and we ask your forgiveness and understanding. We hope that we can make up for it being part of the healing process wherever necessary.Crosby further pledged the need to \"come again to that deep trust and solidarity that constitutes families. We recognize that the road beyond past hurt may be long and steep, but we pledge ourselves anew to journey with the Native Peoples on that road.\"On May 16, 1993, in Idaho, Peter Hans Kolvenbach, then Superior General of the Society of Jesus, issued an apology for the actions of Jesuits in the Western missions and in the \"ways the church was insensitive toward your tribal customs, language and spirituality... The Society of Jesus is sorry for the mistakes it has made in the past\" In 2009, a delegation of 40 First Nations representatives from Canada and several Canadian bishops had a private meeting with Pope Benedict XVI to obtain an apology for abuses that occurred in the residential school system. Then leader of the Assembly of First Nations Grand Chief Phil Fontaine of the First Nations Summit in British Columbia, and Chief Edward John of the Tl\u02bcazt\u02bcen Nation were in attendance. The Indigenous delegation were funded by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. Afterwards, the Holy See released an official expression of sorrow on the church's role in residential schools and \"the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church\":\n\nHis Holiness [i.e. the Pope] emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society. He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.\nFontaine, a residential school survivor, later stated that he had sensed the Pope's \"pain and anguish\" and that the acknowledgement was \"important to [him] and that was what [he] was looking for\". In an interview with CBC News, Fontaine stated in regards to the Pope's acknowledgement of the suffering of the school survivors \"I think in that sense, there was that apology that we were certainly looking for.\" Many argue that Pope Benedict XVI's statement was not a full apology. On 6 June 2021, Fontaine restated his thoughts on Pope Benedict XVI's statement as \"reassuring\" but that \"I believe very strongly that there ought to be a full apology from the Holy Father. He's done so in Ireland, he's done so in Bolivia.In the 2015 Report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), Action 58 called for the Pope to issue an apology similar to Pope Benedict XVI's 2010 pastoral letter to Ireland issued from the Vatican, but be delivered by the Pope on Canadian soil.:\u200a7\u200aOn May 29, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked the current Pope Francis for a public apology to all survivors of the residential school system, rather than the expression of sorrow issued by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009. Trudeau invited the Pope to issue the apology in Canada. Although no commitment for such an apology followed the meeting, he noted that the Pope pointed to a lifelong commitment of supporting marginalized people and an interest in working collaboratively with Trudeau and Canadian bishops to establish a way forward.On June 10, 2021, a delegation of Indigenous people were announced to meet with the Pope later in the year to discuss the legacy of residential schools. On 29 June, the delegation was scheduled to take place from 17 to 20 December 2021 to comply with COVID-19 global travel restrictions. Archbishop Richard Gagnon, president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops spoke on the topic, stating \"What the Pope said and did in Bolivia is what he will do in Canada.\"On September 24, 2021, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a formal apology for residential schools stating \"We, the Catholic Bishops of Canada, gathered in Plenary this week, take this opportunity to affirm to you, the Indigenous Peoples of this land, that we acknowledge the suffering experienced in Canada\u2019s Indian Residential Schools. Many Catholic religious communities and dioceses participated in this system, which led to the suppression of Indigenous languages, culture and spirituality, failing to respect the rich history, traditions and wisdom of Indigenous Peoples. We acknowledge the grave abuses that were committed by some members of our Catholic community; physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual, cultural, and sexual.\" Assembly of First Nations Chief RoseAnne Archibald stated she felt conflicted, saying \"On one hand, their unequivocal apology is welcomed,\" but that she was disappointed that the Bishops had not issued a formal request for the Pope to visit Canada in person. The Catholic Bishops also stated \"We are fully committed to the process of healing and reconciliation. Together with the many pastoral initiatives already underway in dioceses across the country, and as a further tangible expression of this ongoing commitment, we are pledging to undertake fundraising in each region of the country to support initiatives discerned locally with Indigenous partners. Furthermore, we invite the Indigenous Peoples to journey with us into a new era of reconciliation, helping us in each of our dioceses across the country to prioritize initiatives of healing, to listen to the experience of Indigenous Peoples, especially to the survivors of Indian Residential Schools, and to educate our clergy, consecrated men and women, and lay faithful, on Indigenous cultures and spirituality. We commit ourselves to continue the work of providing documentation or records that will assist in the memorialization of those buried in unmarked graves\" The Bishops also stated \"Pope Francis will encounter and listen to the Indigenous participants, so as to discern how he can support our common desire to renew relationships and walk together along the path of hope in the coming years\" with some interpreting this visit as an important step that could lead to a formal visit to Canada by the Pope\n\n\n=== Anglican ===\nOn August 6, 1993, at the National Native Convocation in Minaki, Ontario. Archbishop Michael Peers apologized to residential school survivors, on behalf of the Anglican Church of Canada.\n\n\n=== Presbyterian ===\nOn June 9, 1994, the Presbyterian Church in Canada adopted a confession at its 120th General Assembly in Toronto on June 5, recognizing its role in residential schools and seeking forgiveness. The confession was presented on October 8 during a ceremony in Winnipeg.We ask, also, for forgiveness from Aboriginal peoples. What we have heard we acknowledge. It is our hope that those whom we have wronged with a hurt too deep for telling will accept what we have to say. With God's guidance our Church will seek opportunities to walk with Aboriginal peoples to find healing and wholeness together as God's people.\n\n\n=== Canadian Government ===\n\n\n==== Royal Canadian Mounted Police ====\nIn 2004, immediately before signing the first Public Safety Protocol with the Assembly of First Nations, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli issued an apology on behalf of the RCMP for its role in the Indian residential school system: \"We, I, as Commissioner of the RCMP, am truly sorry for what role we played in the residential school system and the abuse that took place in the residential system.\"\n\n\n==== Federal government ====\nIn 2007, after the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement was accepted by Prime Minister Paul Martin's Government in 2005, activists called for Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government to apologize. The Harper government refused, stating an apology was not part of the agreement. On May 1, 2007, MP Gary Merasty, of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation introduced a motion for an apology, which passed unanimously.On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology, on behalf of the sitting Cabinet, in front of an audience of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the CBC, for the past governments' policies of assimilation. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a Committee of the Whole was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.Harper's apology excluded Newfoundland and Labrador on the basis that the government should not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Moravian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created under the auspices of the Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1,000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. Lawyers expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.On November 24, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a formal apology to former Innu, Inuit and NunatuKavut school survivors and their families during a ceremony in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador. He acknowledged that students experienced multiple forms of abuse linking their treatment to the colonial thinking that shaped the school system. Trudeau's apology was received on behalf of residential school survivors by Toby Obed who framed the apology as a key part of the healing process that connected survivors from Newfoundland and Labrador with school attendees from across the country. Members of the Innu Nation were less receptive, rejecting the apology ahead of the ceremony. Grand Chief Gregory Rich noted in a released statement that he was \"not satisfied that Canada understands yet what it has done to Innu and what it is still doing\", indicating that members felt they deserved an apology for more than their experiences at residential schools.\n\n\n==== Provincial ====\nOn June 22, 2015, Rachel Notley, Premier of Alberta, issued a formal apology as a ministerial statement in a bid to begin to address the wrongs done by the government to the Indigenous peoples of Alberta and the rest of Canada. Notley's provincial government called on the federal government to hold an inquiry on the missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada at the same time. The government also stated its intent to build relationships with provincial leaders of Indigenous communities, and sought to amend the provincial curriculum to include the history of Indigenous culture.On June 18, 2015, Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger became the first politician to issue a formal apology for the government's role in the Sixties Scoop. Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action \u2013 including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims \u2013 must accompany words for them to have real meaning.On May 30, 2016, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne apologized at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on behalf of the provincial government for the harm done at residential schools. Affirming Ontario's commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, she acknowledged the school system as \"one of the most shameful chapters in Canadian history\". In a 105-minute ceremony, Wynne announced that the Ontario government would spend $250 million on education initiatives and would also rename the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. It was further announced that the first week of November would be known as Treaties Recognition Week.\n\n\n==== Calls for Queen Elizabeth II to apologize ====\nOn February 21, 2008, the Manitoba Keewatinook Ininew Okimowin Tribal Council, representing 30 northern Manitoba indigenous communities, requested Queen Elizabeth II to apologise for the residential schools in Canada. Grand Chief of the council Sydney Garrioch sent a letter with this request to Buckingham Palace.On Canada Day, July 1, 2021, in Winnipeg, the statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II in front of the Manitoba Legislature were vandalized and toppled. The head of the Queen Victoria statue was removed and thrown into the Assiniboine River. After the toppling of the statues, Associate Professor of sociology at the University of Winnipeg Kimberley Ducey called for Queen Elizabeth II to apologize for the role of the British monarchy in the establishment of residential schools.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nOn October 27, 2011, University of Manitoba president David Barnard apologized to the TRC for the institution's role in educating people who operated the residential school system. The Winnipeg Free Press believed it to be the first time a Canadian university has apologized for playing a role in residential schools.\nOn April 9, 2018, the University of British Columbia (UBC) opened the Indian Residential School History & Dialogue Centre as West Coast complement the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, in Winnipeg. At the opening, UBC President Santa Ono apologized to residential school victims and dignitaries including Grand Chief Edward John and Canadian Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. Ono apologised for UBC's training of policymakers and administrators who operated the system and stated:On behalf of the university and all its people, I apologize to all of you who are survivors of the residential schools, to your families and communities and to all Indigenous people for the role this university played in perpetuating that system...We apologize for the actions and inaction of our predecessors and renew our commitment to working with all of you for a more just and equitable future.\n\n\n== Reconciliation ==\n\nIn the summer of 1990, the Mohawks of Kanesatake confronted the government about its failure to honour Indigenous land claims and recognize traditional Mohawk territory in Oka, Quebec. Referred to by media outlets as the Oka Crisis, the land dispute sparked a critical discussion about the Canadian government's complacency regarding relations with Indigenous communities and responses to their concerns. The action prompted then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to underscore four government responsibilities: \"resolving land claims; improving the economic and social conditions on reserves; defining a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and governments; and addressing the concerns of Canada's aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life.\":\u200a240\u200a The actions of the Mohawk community members led to, in part, along with objections from Indigenous leaders regarding the Meech Lake Accord, the creation of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples to examine the status of Indigenous peoples in Canada. In 1996, the Royal Commission presented a final report which first included a vision for meaningful and action-based reconciliation.:\u200a239\u2013240\u200a\n\n\n=== Ecclesiastical projects ===\nIn 1975, the Anglican, Roman Catholic and United Churches, along with six other churches, formed Project North, later known as the Aboriginal Rights Coalition (ARC), with the objective of \"transformation of the relationship between Canadian society and Aboriginal peoples.\" The campaign's objectives were:\n\n\"The recognition of Aboriginal land and treaty rights in Canada;\nRealizing the historic rights of Aboriginal peoples as they are recognized in the Canadian constitution and upheld in the courts, including the right to self-determination\nReversing the erosion of social rights, including rights to adequate housing, education, health care and appropriate legal systems;\nSeeking reconciliation between Aboriginal peoples, the Christian community and Canadian society;\nClarifying the moral and spiritual basis for action towards Aboriginal and social justice in Canada;\nOpposing development and military projects that threaten Aboriginal communities and the environment; and\nPromoting Aboriginal justice within Jubilee.\"The churches have also engaged in reconciliation initiatives such as the Returning to Spirit: Residential School Healing and Reconciliation Program, a workshop that aims to unite Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through discussing the legacy of residential schools and fostering an environment for them to communicate and develop mutual understanding. In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health organizations such as the AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their active participation in these healing efforts.In 1992, The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund for Healing and Reconciliation to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. From 1992 to 2007, the fund funded over $8 million towards 705 projects.In October 1997, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) agreed on the establishment of the Council for Reconciliation, Solidarity and Communion for the following year. In 2007, the council became the Catholic Aboriginal Council. On November 30, 1999, the CCCB signed an agreement with the Assembly of First Nations, represented by Grand Chief Phil Fontaine.In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & Reconciliation Program.\n\n\n=== Financial compensation ===\nIn January 1998, the government made a \"statement of reconciliation\" \u2013 including an apology to those people who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools \u2013 and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF). The foundation was provided with $350 million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual abuse. In its 2005 budget, the Canadian government committed an additional $40 million to support the work of the AHF. Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014. Former AHF executive director Mike DeGagne has said that the loss of AHF support has created a gap in dealing with mental health crises such as suicides in the Attawapiskat First Nation.In June 2001, the government established Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada as an independent government department to manage the residential school file. In 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process was launched as part of a larger National Resolution Framework which included health supports, a commemoration component and a strategy for litigation. As explained by the TRC, the ADR was designed as a \"voluntary process for resolution of certain claims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and forcible confinement, without having to go through the civil litigation process\".:\u200a564\u200a It was created by the Canadian government without consultation with Indigenous communities or former residential school students. The ADR system also made it the responsibility of the former students to prove that the abuse occurred and was intentional, resulting in former students finding the system difficult to navigate, re-traumatizing, and discriminatory. Many survivor advocacy groups and Indigenous political organizations such as the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) worked to have the ADR system dissolved. In 2004 the Assembly of First Nations released a report critical of the ADR underscoring, among other issues, the failure of survivors to automatically receive the full amount of compensation without subsequent ligation against the church and failure to compensate for lost family, language and culture.:\u200a565\u200a The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development released its own report in April 2005 finding the ADR to be \"an excessively costly and inappropriately applied failure, for which the Minister and her officials are unable to raise a convincing defence\".:\u200a566\u200a Within a month of the report's release a Supreme Court of Canada decision granted school attendees the right to pursue class-action suits, which ultimately led to a government review of the compensation process.:\u200a566\u200aOn November 23, 2005, the Canadian government announced a $1.9-billion compensation package to benefit tens of thousands of former students. National Chief of the AFN, Phil Fontaine, said the package was meant to cover \"decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities\". Justice Minister Irwin Cotler applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was \"the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history\". At an Ottawa news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said: \"We have made good on our shared resolve to deliver what I firmly believe will be a fair and lasting resolution of the Indian school legacy.\"The compensation package led to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), announced on May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth and Reconciliation program, as well as an individual Common Experience Payment (CEP). Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was based on the number of years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.:\u200a44\u200aThe IRSSA also included the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), a case-by-case, out-of-court resolution process designed to provide compensation for sexual, physical and emotional abuse. The IAP process was built on the ADR program and all IAP claims from former students are examined by an adjudicator. The IAP became available to all former students of residential schools on September 19, 2007. Former students who experienced abuse and wished to pursue compensation had to apply by themselves or through a lawyer of their choice to receive consideration. The deadline to apply for the IAP was September 19, 2012. This gave former students of residential schools four years from the implementation date of the IRSSA to apply for the IAP. Claims involving physical and sexual abuse were compensated up to $275,000. By September 30, 2016, the IAP had resolved 36,538 claims and paid $3.1 billion in compensation.The IRSSA also proposed an advance payment for former students alive and who were 65 years old and over as of May 30, 2005. The deadline for reception of the advance payment form by IRSRC was December 31, 2006. Following a legal process, including an examination of the IRSSA by the courts of the provinces and territories of Canada, an \"opt-out\" period occurred. During this time, the former students of residential schools could reject the agreement if they did not agree with its dispositions. This opt-out period ended on August 20, 2007, with about 350 former students opting out. The IRSSA was the largest class action settlement in Canadian history. By December 2012, a total of $1.62 billion was paid to 78,750 former students, 98 per cent of the 80,000 who were eligible. In 2014, the IRSSA funds left over from CEPs were offered for educational credits for survivors and their families.\n\n\n=== Truth and Reconciliation Commission ===\n\nIn 2008, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to travel across Canada collecting the testimonies of people affected by the residential school system. About 7,000 Indigenous people told their stories. The TRC concluded in 2015 with the publication of a six volume, 4,000-plus-page report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. It resulted in the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.The executive summary of the TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide.:\u200a1\u200a The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that would be difficult to prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.Among the 94 Calls to Action that accompanied the conclusion of the TRC were recommendations to ensure that all Canadians are educated and made aware of the residential school system.:\u200a175\u2013176\u200a Justice Murray Sinclair explained that the recommendations were not aimed solely at prompting government action, but instead a collective move toward reconciliation in which all Canadians have a role to play: \"Many of our elements, many of our recommendations and many of the Calls to Action are actually aimed at Canadian society.\"Preservation of documentation of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted as part of the TRC's Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses. On April 4, 2016, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.In March 2017, Lynn Beyak, a Conservative member of the Senate Standing Committee of Aboriginal Peoples, voiced disapproval of the final TRC report, saying that it had omitted the positives of the schools. Although Beyak's right to free speech was defended by some Conservative senators, her comments were widely criticized by members of the opposition, among them Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, Carolyn Bennett, and leader of the New Democratic Party, Tom Mulcair. The Anglican Church also raised concerns stating in a release co-signed by bishops Fred Hiltz and Mark MacDonald: \"There was nothing good about children going missing and no report being filed. There was nothing good about burying children in unmarked graves far from their ancestral homes.\" In response, the Conservative Party leadership removed Beyak from the Senate committee underscoring that her comments did not align with the views of the party.\n\n\n=== Educational initiatives ===\n\nFor many communities the buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a traumatic reminder of the system's legacy; demolition, heritage status and the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process have been discussed. In July 2016, it was announced that the building of the former Mohawk Institute Residential School would be converted into an educational centre with exhibits on the legacy of residential schools. Ontario's Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, David Zimmer, noted: \"Its presence will always be a reminder of colonization and the racism of the residential school system; one of the darkest chapters of Canadian history.\"Reconciliation efforts have also been undertaken by several Canadian universities. In 2015 Lakehead University and the University of Winnipeg introduced a mandatory course requirement for all undergraduate students focused on Indigenous culture and history. The same year the University of Saskatchewan hosted a two-day national forum at which Canadian university administrators, scholars and members of Indigenous communities discussed how Canadian universities can and should respond to the TRC's Calls to Action.On April 1, 2017, a 17-metre (56 ft) pole, titled \"Reconciliation Pole\", was raised on the grounds of the University of British Columbia (UBC) Vancouver campus. Carved by Haida master carver and hereditary chief, 7idansuu () (Edenshaw), James Hart, the pole tells the story of the residential school system prior to, during and after its operation. It features thousands of copper nails, used to represent the children who died in Canadian residential schools, and depictions of residential school survivors carved by artists from multiple Indigenous communities, including Canadian Inuk director Zacharias Kunuk, Maliseet artist Shane Perley-Dutcher, and Muqueam Coast Salish artist Susan Point.In October 2016, Canadian singer-songwriter Gord Downie released Secret Path, a concept album about Chanie Wenjack's escape and death. It was accompanied by a graphic novel and animated film, aired on CBC Television. Proceeds went to the University of Manitoba's Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Following his death in October 2017, Downie's brother Mike said he was aware of 40,000 teachers who had used the material in their classrooms, and hoped to continue this. In December 2017, Downie was posthumously named Canadian Newsmaker of the Year by the Canadian Press, in part because of his work with reconciliation efforts for survivors of residential schools.\n\n\n=== National Day for Truth and Reconciliation ===\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 80th call to action was for the government to designate a National Day for Truth and Reconciliation that would become a statutory holiday to honour the survivors, their families, and communities. In August 2018, the government announced it was considering three possible dates as the new national holiday. After consultation, Orange Shirt Day was selected as the holiday.Orange Shirt Day pre-existed the government's efforts to make it a holiday. The day started in 2013, when at a residential school reunion, survivor Phyllis Jack Webstad told her story. She recounted how her grandmother bought her a new orange shirt to go to school in, and when she arrived at the residential school, the shirt was stripped away from her and never returned. The other survivors founded the SJM Project, and on September 30, 2013\u2014the time of the year when indigenous children were taken away to residential schools\u2014they encouraged students in schools in the area to wear an orange shirt in memory of the victims of the residential school system. The observance of the holiday spread quickly across Canada, and in 2017 the Canadian government encouraged all Canadians to participate in the observance of Orange Shirt Day.On March 21, 2019, Georgina Jolibois submitted a private member's bill to call for Orange Shirt Day to become a statutory holiday; the bill passed the House of Commons, but the next election was called before the bill could pass the Senate and become law. After the election, Steven Guilbeault reintroduced the bill to make Orange Shirt Day a national statutory holiday. Following the discovery of the remains of 215 children on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School on May 24, 2021, Parliament agreed to pass the bill unanimously, and the bill received royal assent on June 3, 2021.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes on terminology ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"How do I reach the 24 Hour Crisis Line?\".

                "title": "Charter school",
                "summary": "A charter school  is a school that receives government funding but operates independently of the established state school system in which it is located. It is independent in the sense that it operates according to the basic principle of autonomy for accountability, that it is freed from the rules but accountable for results.\n\n",

It is independent in the sense that it operates according to the basic principle of autonomy for accountability, that it is freed from the rules but accountable for results.\n\n\n== Public vs. private school ==\nCharter schools are publicly funded through taxation and operated by privately owned management companies. Charter schools are often established, operated, and maintained by for-profit organizations, and are not necessarily held to the same standards as traditional public schools.\nThere is debate on whether charter schools should be described as private schools or state schools. Advocates of the charter model state that they are public schools because they are open to all students and do not charge tuition. Charter School critics assert that charter schools' private operation with lack of public accountability makes them more like private institutions subsidized by the public.\n\n\n== By country ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nAll Australian private schools have received some federal government funding since the 1970s. Since then they have educated approximately 30% of high school students. None of them are charter schools, as all charge tuition fees.\nSince 2009, the Government of Western Australia has been trialling the Independent Public School (IPS) Initiative.  These public schools have greater autonomy and could be regarded as akin to 'charter' Schools (but the term is not used in Australia).\n\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\nThe first charter school in Bulgaria, 151 General Education School with Interest-Based Profiles, was established in 1990 in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nThe Canadian province of Alberta enacted legislation in 1994 enabling charter schools. The first charter schools under the new legislation were established in 1995: New Horizons Charter School, Suzuki Charter School, and the Centre for Academic and Personal Excellence. As of 2015, Alberta remains the only Canadian province that has enabled charter schools.There are 23 charter school campuses operated by 13 Alberta charter schools. The number of charter schools was limited to a maximum of 15, but the Provincial government eliminated this cap effective September 2020.\n\n\n=== Chile ===\nChile has a very long history of private subsidized schooling, akin to charter schooling in the United States. Before the 1980s, most private subsidized schools were religious and owned by churches or other private parties, but they received support from the central government. In the 1980s, the government of Augusto Pinochet promoted neoliberal reforms in the country. In 1981 a competitive voucher system in education was adopted. These vouchers could be used in public schools or private subsidized schools (which can be run for profit). After this reform, the share of private subsidized schools, many of them secular, grew from 18.5% of schools in 1980 to 32.7% of schools in 2001. As of 2012, nearly 60% of Chilean students study in charter schools.\n\n\n=== England and Wales ===\n\nThe United Kingdom established grant-maintained schools in England and Wales in 1988. They allowed individual schools that were independent of the local school authority. When they were abolished in 1998, most turned into foundation schools, which are really under their local district authority but still have a high degree of autonomy.\nPrior to the 2010 general election, there were about 200 academies (publicly funded schools with a significant degree of autonomy) in England.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nDue to Art. 7 of the Grundgesetz (German constitution), private schools may only be set up if they do not increase the segregation of pupils by their parents' income class. In return, all private schools are supported financially by government bodies, comparable to charter schools. The amount of control over school organization, curriculum etc. taken over by the state differs from state to state and from school to school. Average financial support given by government bodies was 85% of total costs in 2009. Academically, all private schools must lead their students to the ability to attain standardized, government-provided external tests such as the Abitur.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n\nSome private schools in Hong Kong receive government subsidy under the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS). DSS schools are free to design their curriculum, select their own students, and charge for tuition. A number of DSS schools were formerly state schools prior to joining the scheme.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nCharter schools in Ireland were set up mostly in the 1700s by the Church of Ireland to educate the poor. They were state or charity sponsored, but run by the church. The model to copy was Kilkenny College, but critics like Bernard Mandeville felt that educating too many poor children would lead them to have unrealistic expectations. Notable examples are the Collegiate School Celbridge, Midleton College, Wilson's Hospital School and The King's Hospital.\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n\nCharter schools in New Zealand, labelled as Partnership schools | kura hourua, were allowed for after an agreement between the National Party and the ACT Party following the 2011 general election. The controversial legislation passed with a five-vote majority. A small number of charter schools started in 2013 and 2014. All cater for students who have struggled in the normal state school system. Most of the students have issues with drugs, alcohol, poor attendance and achievement. Most of the students are Maori or Pacific Islander. One of the schools is set up as a military academy. One of the schools ran into major difficulties within weeks of starting. It is now being run by an executive manager from Child, Youth and Family, a government social welfare organization, together with a commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Education. 36 organizations have applied to start charter schools.\n\n\n=== Norway ===\n\nAs in Sweden, the publicly funded but privately run charter schools in Norway are named friskoler and was formally instituted in 2003, but dismissed in 2007. Private schools have since medieval times been a part of the education system, and is today consisting of 63 Montessori and 32 Steiner (Waldorf) charter schools, some religious schools and 11 non-governmental funded schools like the Oslo International School, the German School Max Tau and the French School Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais, a total of 195 schools.\nAll charter schools can have a list of admission priorities, but only the non-governmental funded schools are allowed to select their students and to make a profit. The charter schools cannot have entrance exams, and supplemental fees are very restricted. In 2013, a total of 19,105 children were enrolled in privately run schools.\n\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\nThe Swedish system of friskolor (\"free schools\") was instituted in 1992. These are publicly funded by school vouchers and can be run by not-for-profits as well as for-profit companies. The schools are restricted: for example, they are prohibited from supplementing the public funds with tuition or other fees; pupils must be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis; and entrance exams are not permitted. There are about 900 charter schools throughout the country.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nAccording to the Education Commission of the States, \"charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor). This contract \u2013 or charter \u2013 details how the school will be organized and managed, what students will be expected to achieve, and how success will be measured. Many charters are exempt from a variety of laws and regulations affecting other public schools if they continue to meet the terms of their charters.\" These schools, however, need to follow State-mandated curriculum and are subject to the same rules and regulations that cover it, although there is flexibility in the way it is designed.\n\nMinnesota passed the first charter school law in the United States in 1991. As of 2015, Minnesota had 165 registered charter schools, with over 41,000 students attending. The first of these to be approved, Bluffview Montessori School in Winona, Minnesota, opened in 1992. The first charter to operate was City Academy in St. Paul. Some specialized Minnesota charter schools include the Metro Deaf School (1993), Community of Peace Academy (1995), and the Mainstreet School of Performing Arts (2004).As of December 2011 approximately 5,600 charter schools enrolled an estimated total of more than 2 million students nationwide. The numbers equate to a 13% growth in students in just one year, while more than 400,000 students remain on charter school waitlists. Over 500 new charter schools opened their doors in the 2011\u201312 school year, an estimated increase of 200,000 students. This year marks the largest single-year increase ever recorded in terms of the number of additional students attending charter schools.The most radical experimentation with charter schools in the United States possibly occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (2005). As of 2009 the New Orleans Public Schools system was engaged in reforms aimed at decentralizing power away from the pre-Katrina public school board to individual charter school principals and boards, monitoring charter school performance by granting renewable, five-year operating contracts permitting the closure of those not succeeding, and parents the choice to enroll their children in almost any school in the district. New Orleans is one of two cities in the United States of America where the majority of school students attend charter schools. 78% of all New Orleans schoolchildren studied in charter schools during the 2011\u201312 school year. As of May  2014, all but five of New Orleans' schools were charter schools.Unlike their public counterparts, laws governing charter schools vary greatly. The three states with the highest number of students enrolled in charter schools are California, Arizona, and Michigan. These differences largely relate to what types of public agencies are permitted to authorize the creation of charter schools, whether or not and through what processes private schools can convert to charter schools, and what certification, if any, charter school teachers require.\nIn California, local school districts are the most frequent granters of school charters. If a local school district denies a charter application, or if the proposed charter school provides services not provided by the local school districts, a county board consisting of superintendents from state schools or the state board of education can grant a charter. The Arizona State Board for Charter Schools grants charters in Arizona. Local school districts and the state board of education can also grant charters. In contrast, the creation of charter schools in Michigan can be authorized only by local school boards or by the governing school boards of state colleges and universities.Different states with charter school legislation have adopted widely different positions in regard to the conversion of private schools to charter schools. California, for example, does not allow the conversion of private schools into charter schools. Both Arizona and Michigan allow such conversions, but with different requirements. A private school wishing to convert to a charter school in Michigan, for example, must show that at least 25% of its student population is made up of new students. Legislation in Arizona stipulates that private schools that wish to become charter schools within that state must have admission policies that are fair and non-discriminatory. Also, while Michigan and California require teachers at charter schools to hold state certification, those in Arizona do not.\nCharter schools were targeted as a major component of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. Specifically, the act specifies that students attending schools labeled as under-performing by state standards now have the option to transfer to a different school in the district, whether it is a state, private, or charter school. The act also suggested that if a failing school cannot show adequate yearly progress, it will be designated a charter school.\nAs of 2005 there were almost 100 charter schools in North Carolina, the limit passed by legislation in 1996. The 1996 legislation dictates that there will be no more than five charter schools operating within one school district at any given time. It was passed in order to offer parents options in regard to their children and the school they attend, with most of the cost being covered by tax revenue. After the first several years of permitting charter schools in North Carolina, the authority to grant charters shifted from local boards of education to the State Board of Education. This can also be compared with several other states that have various powers that accept charter school applications.\nTypically, charter schools claim nonprofit status, but most operate in a for-profit system.  Additionally, the buildings in which they operate are generally owned by private landlords. Accordingly, this asset class generates interest from real-estate investors as well as building contractors. Charter schools have grown in number in the US since the 1990s, but have experienced many failures. A recent study found that more than a quarter of new charter schools had closed after 5 years, and after just 15 years of operation, about half had closed.  As of 2015, 6,700 charter schools enroll approximately 2.9 million students in the United States.\n\n\n==== Cyber schools ====\n\nCharter cyber schools operate like typical charter schools in that they are independently organized schools, but are conducted partly or entirely over the Internet. Proponents say this allows for much more flexibility compared with traditional schools.For 2000\u20132001, studies estimated that there are about 45,000 online K\u201312 students nationally. Six years later, a study by Picciano and Seamon (2006) found that over 1 million students were involved. These numbers increased to 6.7 million students in 2013. A study by Watson, Murin, Vashaw, Gemin, and Rapp found that cyber charter schools are currently (as of 2014) operating in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.The increase of these online campuses has aroused controversy. In November, 2015, researchers at the University of Washington, Stanford University, and the Mathematica Policy Research group published the first major study of online charter schools in the United States, the \"National Study of Online Charter Schools\". It found \"significantly weaker academic performance\" in mathematics and reading in such schools when compared to conventional ones. The study resulted from research carried out in 17 US states which had online charter schools. It concluded that keeping online pupils focused on their work was the biggest problem faced by online charter schools and that in mathematics the difference in attainment between online pupils and their conventionally-educated peers equated to the cyber pupils missing a whole academic year in school.Four states have adopted specific legislation tailored to cyber charter schools. One example is Arizona, which has about 3,500 students in cyber schools, about half of them cyber charter schools and the other half governed by traditional, brick-and-mortar public school districts. The cyber schools teach students from kindergarten to 12th grade, and the setting varies from being entirely online in one's home to spending all of the class time in a formal school building while learning over the Internet.Cyber charter school diplomas have been unevenly valued by post-secondary institutions. Universities sometimes apply additional requirements or have cyber-charter quotas limiting the number of applicants. The US military also classifies non-traditional diplomas at a lower tier, although as of 2012 this could be bypassed by high ASVAB test scores.\n\n\n==== Charter schools and public schools ====\nIn 2014, New Orleans became the first place in the United States to establish an all-charter school district, called the Recovery School District.A 2017 policy statement from the National Education Association expressed its strong commitment to public schools. Charter schools are funded by taxpayers so there must be the same liability, transparency, safeguards, and impartiality as public schools. 44 American states along with the District of Columbia implement legislation on state charter schools. However, many states do not compel charters to abide by open meeting statutes as well as prerequisites on conflict of interest that pertain to school districts, boards, and employees.The Trump administration's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was a major proponent of school choice and charter schools.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBradley Foundation\nCharter School Growth Fund\nDreamBox (company)\nBroad Foundation\nKoch Family Foundations\nWalton Foundation\n\n\n== References ==",

The school was permanently closed in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Greek aphorism \"GNOTHI SE\", meaning \"know thyself\", is Delta's motto and was chosen by Mr. Walter Clarke, the school's first Latin teacher. In 1919, projected enrollment predicted overcrowding at Central Collegiate; hence, on July 13, 1922, the debate concerning the second location of the second collegiate ended with the approval of an east-end site. In the years before construction, the Board of Education referred to the new collegiate as the \"East-end Collegiate\" but later adopted the name \"Delta High School\" as the \"Delta\" was well known to Hamiltonians as the land area created by the crossing of the two major arteries, King and Main Streets. On July 5, 1923, Ben Simpson accepted the position of Delta's first principal and in September 1923, under the tutelage of the 5 original staff members, the first Delta students began their classes in Ballard Elementary School. Delta's doors were opened in September 1924, with 15 additional staff members and almost 700 students. In November of the same year, Delta was declared formally open by G. Howard Ferguson, Premier of Ontario and Minister of Education. Experts in construction and architecture pronounced Delta \"the finest school in the Dominion of Canada\" and following Ministry inspection, the High School was raised to the status of a Collegiate Institute.\nFounded in 1925, Delta Secondary School's first principal was Mr. Ben Simpson of the Hamilton Collegiate Institute and a renowned Hamilton Tiger football player. The school was one of the first schools in Hamilton to offer commercial classes in writing, book-keeping, business forms, commercial law, and phonography.\nDelta was scheduled to be closed in June 2015. Efforts to create an alternative solution to closing were made given the age of the building, the history, and the vital role that the school plays in the lives of students and the neighbourhood. The school was then closed after the 2018-2019 school year.\n\n\n== Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program ==\nDelta Secondary School took part in the Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program, funded by the Government of Ontario. The Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program (OYAP) is a School to Work program that opens the door for students to explore and work in apprenticeship occupations starting in Grade 11 or Grade 12 through the Cooperative Education program. The program gives students the opportunity to become registered apprentices and work towards becoming certified journey-persons in a skilled trade while completing their secondary school diplomas.\nThe goals of OYAP are:\n\nTo provide students with the opportunity to start training in a skilled trade while completing the requirements for an Ontario Secondary School Diploma\nTo enable students to make the school to work transition by direct entry into apprenticeship training\nTo provide employers with the opportunity to train the skilled workers they require\nTo provide a viable solution to address the problem of skilled tradespeople shortages in general, and specifically the lack of young people joining the trades.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of high schools in Ontario\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDelta Secondary School Website\nDelta Secondary School profile",

                "content": "Clarissa Harlowe Barton (December 25, 1821 \u2013 April 12, 1912) was an American nurse who founded the American Red Cross. She was a hospital nurse in the American Civil War, a teacher, and a patent clerk. Since nursing education was not then very formalized and she did not attend nursing school, she provided self-taught nursing care. Barton is noteworthy for doing humanitarian work and civil rights advocacy at a time before women had the right to vote. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nClarissa Harlowe Barton was born December 25, 1821, in North Oxford, Massachusetts, and was named after the titular character of Samuel Richardson's novel Clarissa. Her father was Captain Stephen Barton, a member of the local militia and a selectman (politician) who inspired his daughter with patriotism and a broad humanitarian interest. He was a soldier under the command of General Anthony Wayne in his crusade against the Indigenous in the northwest. He was also the leader of progressive thought in the Oxford village area. Barton's mother was Sarah Stone Barton.\nWhen she was three years old, Barton was sent to school with her brother Stephen, where she excelled in reading and spelling. At school, she became close friends with Nancy Fitts; she is the only known friend Barton had as a child due to her extreme timidity.When Barton was ten years old, she assigned herself the task of nursing her brother David back to health after he fell from the roof of a barn and received a severe head injury. She learned how to distribute the prescribed medication to her brother, as well as how to place leeches on his body to bleed him (a standard treatment at the time). She continued to care for David long after doctors had given up. He made a full recovery.Her parents tried to help cure her timidity by enrolling her to Colonel Stones High School, but their strategy turned out to be a catastrophe. Barton became more timid and depressed and would not eat. She was brought back home to regain her health.\nUpon her return, her family relocated to help a family member; a paternal cousin of Clara's had died and left his wife with four children and a farm. The house that the Barton family was to live in needed to be painted and repaired. Clara was persistent in offering assistance, much to the gratitude of her family. After the work was done, she was at a loss because there wasn't anything else to help with, to not feel like a burden to her family.She began to play with her boy cousins and to their surprise, she was good at keeping up with such activities as horseback riding. It wasn't until after she had injured herself that Clara's mother began to question her playing with the boys. Her mother decided she should focus on more ladylike skills. She invited one of Clara's girl cousins over to help develop her femininity. From her cousin, she gained proper social skills as well.To assist Barton with overcoming her shyness, her parents persuaded her to become a schoolteacher. She achieved her first teacher's certificate in 1839, at only 17 years old. This profession interested Barton greatly and helped motivate her; she ended up conducting an effective redistricting campaign that allowed the children of workers to receive an education. Successful projects such as this gave Barton the confidence needed when she demanded equal pay for teaching.\n\n\n== Early professional life ==\nBarton became an educator in 1838 and served for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared well as a teacher; she knew how to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys since as a child she enjoyed her boy cousins' and brothers' company. She learned how to act like them, making it easier for her to relate to and control the boys in her care. After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. In this college, she developed many friendships that broadened her point of view on many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance. As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to understand. Her writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen.While teaching in Hightstown, Barton learned about the lack of public schools in Bordentown, the neighboring city. In 1852, she was contracted to open a free school in Bordentown, which was the first ever free school in New Jersey. She was successful, and after a year she had hired another woman to help teach over 600 people. Both women were making $250 a year. This accomplishment compelled the town to raise nearly $4,000 for a new school building. Once completed, though, Barton was replaced as principal by a man elected by the school board. They saw the position as head of a large institution to be unfitting for a woman. She was demoted to \"female assistant\" and worked in a harsh environment until she had a nervous breakdown along with other health ailments, and quit.In 1855, she moved to Washington D.C. and began work as a clerk in the US Patent Office; this was the first time a woman had received a substantial clerkship in the federal government and at a salary equal to a man's salary. For three years, she received much abuse and slander from male clerks. Subsequently, under political opposition to women working in government offices, her position was reduced to that of copyist, and in 1858, under the administration of James Buchanan, she was fired because of her \"Black Republicanism\". After the election of Abraham Lincoln, having lived with relatives and friends in Massachusetts for three years, she returned to the patent office in the autumn of 1861, now as temporary copyist, in the hope she could make way for more women in government service.\n\n\n== American Civil War ==\n\nOn April 19, 1861, the Baltimore Riot resulted in the first bloodshed of the American Civil War. The victims, members of the 6th Massachusetts Militia, were transported after the violence to the unfinished Capitol Building in Washington D.C., where Barton lived at the time. Wanting to serve her country, Barton went to the railroad station when the victims arrived and nursed 40 men. Barton provided crucial, personal assistance to the men in uniform, many of whom were wounded, hungry and without supplies other than what they carried on their backs. She personally took supplies to the building to help the soldiers.\nBarton quickly recognized them, as she had grown up with some of them and even taught some. Barton, along with several other women, personally provided clothing, food, and supplies for the sick and wounded soldiers. She learned how to store and distribute medical supplies and offered emotional support to the soldiers by keeping their spirits high. She would read books to them, write letters to their families for them, talk to them, and support them.It was on that day that she identified herself with army work and began her efforts towards collecting medical supplies for the Union soldiers. Prior to distributing provisions directly onto the battlefield and gaining further support, Barton used her own living quarters as a storeroom and distributed supplies with the help of a few friends in early 1862, despite opposition in the War Department and among field surgeons. Ladies' Aid Society helped in sending bandages, food, and clothing that would later be distributed during the Civil War.  In August 1862, Barton finally gained permission from Quartermaster Daniel Rucker to work on the front lines.  She gained support from other people who believed in her cause.  These people became her patrons, her most supportive being Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts.After the First Battle of Bull Run, Barton placed an ad in a Massachusetts newspaper for supplies; the response was a profound influx of supplies. She worked to distribute stores, clean field hospitals, apply dressings, and serve food to wounded soldiers in close proximity to several battles, including Cedar Mountain, Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg. Barton helped both Union and Confederate soldiers. Supplies were not always readily available though. At the battle of Antietam, for example, Barton used corn-husks in place of bandages.In 1863 she began a romantic relationship with an officer, Colonel John J. Elwell.In 1864, she was appointed by Union General Benjamin Butler as the \"lady in charge\" of the hospitals at the front of the Army of the James. Among her more harrowing experiences was an incident in which a bullet tore through the sleeve of her dress without striking her and killed a man to whom she was tending. She was known as the \"Florence Nightingale of America\". She was also known as the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" after she came to the aid of the overwhelmed surgeon on duty following the battle of Cedar Mountain in Northern Virginia in August 1862.  She arrived at a field hospital at midnight with a large number of supplies to help the severely wounded soldiers. This naming came from her frequent timely assistance as she served troops at the battles of Fairfax Station, Chantilly, Harpers Ferry, South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Charleston, Petersburg and Cold Harbor.\n\n\n== Post American Civil War ==\nAfter the end of the American Civil War, Barton discovered that thousands of letters from distraught relatives to the War Department were going unanswered because the soldiers they were questioning about were buried in unmarked graves. Many of these soldiers were labeled just as \"missing\". Motivated to do more about the situation, Miss Barton contacted President Lincoln in hopes that she would be allowed to respond officially to these unanswered inquiries. She was given permission, and \"The Search for the Missing Men\" commenced.After the war, she ran the Office of Missing Soldiers, at 437 \u00bd Seventh Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. in the Gallery Place neighborhood. The office's purpose was to find or identify soldiers killed or missing in action. Barton and her assistants wrote 41,855 replies to inquiries and helped locate more than 22,000 missing men. Barton spent the summer of 1865 helping find, identify, and properly bury 13,000 individuals who died in Andersonville prison camp, a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp in Georgia. She continued this task over the next four years, burying 20,000 more Union soldiers and marking their graves. Congress eventually appropriated $15,000 toward her project.\n\n\n== American Red Cross ==\n\nBarton achieved widespread recognition by delivering lectures around the country about her war experiences in 1865\u20131868. During this time she met Susan B. Anthony and began an association with the woman's suffrage movement. She also became acquainted with Frederick Douglass and became an activist for civil rights.  After her countrywide tour she was both mentally and physically exhausted and under doctor's orders to go somewhere that would take her far from her current work. She closed the Missing Soldiers Office in 1868 and traveled to Europe. In 1869, during her trip to Geneva, Switzerland, Barton was introduced to the Red Cross and Dr. Appia; he later would invite her to be the representative for the American branch of the Red Cross and help her find financial benefactors for the start of the American Red Cross. She was also introduced to Henry Dunant's book A Memory of Solferino, which called for the formation of national societies to provide relief voluntarily on a neutral basis.\nIn the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, in 1870, she assisted the Grand Duchess of Baden in the preparation of military hospitals and gave the Red Cross society much aid during the war. At the joint request of the German authorities and the Strasbourg Comit\u00e9 de Secours, she superintended the supplying of work to the poor of Strasbourg in 1871, after the Siege of Paris, and in 1871 had charge of the public distribution of supplies to the destitute people of Paris. At the close of the war, she received honorable decorations of the Golden Cross of Baden and the Prussian Iron Cross.When Barton returned to the United States, she inaugurated a movement to gain recognition for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) by the United States government. In 1873, she began work on this project.  In 1878, she met with President Rutherford B. Hayes, who expressed the opinion of most Americans at that time which was the U.S. would never again face a calamity like the Civil War. Barton finally succeeded during the administration of President Chester Arthur, using the argument that the new American Red Cross could respond to crises other than war such as natural disasters like earthquakes, forest fires, and hurricanes.\nBarton became President of the American branch of the society, which held its first official meeting at her I Street apartment in Washington, DC, May 21, 1881. The first local society was founded August 22, 1881 in Dansville, Livingston County, New York, where she maintained a country home.The society's role changed with the advent of the Spanish\u2013American War during which it aided refugees and prisoners of the civil war. Once the Spanish\u2013American War was over the grateful people of Santiago built a statue in honor of Barton in the town square, which still stands there today. In the United States, Barton was praised in numerous newspapers and reported about Red Cross operations in person.\n\nDomestically in 1884 she helped in the floods on the Ohio river, provided Texas with food and supplies during the famine of 1887, took workers to Illinois in 1888 after a tornado, and that same year took workers to Florida for the yellow fever epidemic. Within days after the Johnstown Flood in 1889, she led her delegation of 50 doctors and nurses in response. In 1896, responding to the humanitarian crisis in the Ottoman Empire of the Hamidian massacres, Barton arrived in  Constantinople February 15. Barton along with Minister Terrell spoke with Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, to procure the right to enter the interior.  Barton herself stayed in Constantinople to conduct the business of the expedition. Her General Field Agent, J. B. Hubbell, M.D.; two Special Field Agents, E. M. Wistar and C. K. Wood; and Ira Harris M. D., Physician in Charge of Medical Relief in Zeitoun and Marash, traveled to the Armenian provinces in the spring of 1896, providing relief and humanitarian aid. Barton also worked in hospitals in Cuba in 1898 at the age of 77. Barton's last field operation as President of the American Red Cross was helping victims of the Galveston hurricane in 1900. The operation established an orphanage for children.\nAs criticism arose of her mixing professional and personal resources, Barton was forced to resign as president of the American Red Cross in 1904 at the age of 83 because her egocentric leadership style fit poorly into the formal structure of an organizational charity. She had been forced out of office by a new generation of all-male scientific experts who reflected the realistic efficiency of the Progressive Era rather than her idealistic humanitarianism. In memory of the courageous women of the civil war, the Red Cross Headquarters was founded. During the dedication, not one person said a word. This was done in order to honor the women and their services. After resigning, Barton founded the National First Aid Society.\n\n\n== Final years ==\nShe continued to live in her Glen Echo, Maryland home which also served as the Red Cross Headquarters upon her arrival to the house in 1897. Barton published her autobiography in 1908, titled The Story of My Childhood. On April 12, 1912, she died in her home at the age of 90. The cause of death was pneumonia.\n\n\n== Religious beliefs ==\nAlthough not formally a member of the Universalist Church of America, in a 1905 letter to the widow of Carl Norman Thrasher, she identified herself with her parents' church as a \"Universalist\".\nMy dear friend and sister:\nYour belief that I am a Universalist is as correct as your greater belief that you are one yourself, a belief in which all who are privileged to possess it rejoice. In my case, it was a great gift, like St. Paul, I \"was born free\", and saved the pain of reaching it through years of struggle and doubt.\nMy father was a leader in the building of the church in which Hosea Ballow preached his first dedication sermon. Your historic records will show that the old Huguenot town of Oxford, Mass. erected one of, if not the first Universalist Church in America. In this town I was born; in this church I was reared. In all its reconstructions and remodelings I have taken a part, and I look anxiously for a time in the near future when the busy world will let me once more become a living part of its people, praising God for the advance in the liberal faith of the religions of the world today, so largely due to the teachings of this belief.\nGive, I pray you, dear sister, my warmest congratulations to the members of your society. My best wishes for the success of your annual meeting, and accept my thanks most sincerely for having written me.\n\nFraternally yours, (Signed) Clara Barton. While she was not an active member of her parents' church, Barton wrote about how well known her family was in her hometown and how many relationships her father formed with others in their town through their church and religion.\n\n\n== Clara Barton National Historic Site ==\n\nIn 1975, the Clara Barton National Historic Site, located at 5801 Oxford Road, Glen Echo, Maryland, was established as a unit of the National Park Service at Barton's home, where she spent the last 15 years of her life. As the first National Historic Site dedicated to the accomplishments of a woman, it preserves the early history of the American Red Cross, since the home also served as an early headquarters of the organization.\nThe National Park Service has restored eleven rooms, including the Red Cross offices, the parlors, and Barton's bedroom. Visitors to Clara Barton National Historic Site can gain a sense of how Barton lived and worked. Guides lead tourists through the three levels, emphasizing Barton's use of her unusual home. In 2018 the site was indefinitely closed due to repairs.The North Oxford, Massachusetts, house in which she was born is now also a museum.\n\n\n== Clara Barton's Missing Soldiers Office ==\nIn 1869, Barton closed the Missing Soldiers Office and headed to Europe. The third floor of her old boardinghouse was boarded up in 1913, and the site forgotten. The site was \"lost\" in part because Washington, DC realigned its addressing system in the 1870s. The boardinghouse became 437 \u00bd Seventh Street Northwest (formerly 488-1/2 Seventh Street West).\nIn 1997, General Services Administration carpenter Richard Lyons was hired to check out the building for its demolition. He found a treasure trove of Barton items in the attic, including signs, clothing, Civil War soldier's socks, an army tent, Civil War-era newspapers, and many documents relating to the Office of Missing Soldiers. This discovery led to the NPS saving the building from demolition. It took years, however, for the site to be restored. The Clara Barton's Missing Soldiers Office Museum, run by the National Museum of Civil War Medicine, opened in 2015.\n\n\n== Fictional depictions ==\nNumbering All the Bones by Ann Rinaldi features Barton and Andersonville Prison, a Civil War prison with terrible conditions.\nAngel of Mercy (MGM, 1939) is a biographical short film directed by Edward L. Cahn, starring Sara Haden as Barton and Ann Rutherford as a woman whose brother's death in a Civil War battle inspires her to join Barton in her work.\nIn the NBC TV series Voyagers! (1982\u20131983), Phineas Bogg and Jeffrey Jones travel through time to make sure history proceeds correctly.  In the episode \"The Travels of Marco ... and Friends\", season 1, episode 9, original airdate December 3, 1982, Phineas and Jeffrey rescue Barton (Patricia Donahue) from a burning wagon, but she is on the verge of succumbing to smoke inhalation.  Jeffrey (a young boy from 1982) applies mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (a technique unknown in Barton's time) and saves her life, thus enabling her to go on to found the American Red Cross.\nMandy Moore plays Barton in an episode of Drunk History which features a summary of Barton's accomplishments during and after the Civil War as narrated by Amber Ruffin.\nAmerica: The Motion Picture features a highly fictionalized version of Clara Barton as voiced by Megan Leahy.\nIn the HBO series The Gilded Age (2022), Barton is brought to life by Tony award nominated Linda Emond.\n\n\n== Places named for Clara Barton ==\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nClara Barton Elementary School in Levittown, Pennsylvania\nBarton Hall at Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, New Jersey\nClara Barton Elementary on Del Amo Boulevard in Long Beach, California\nClara Barton Elementary School in Alton, Illinois\nClara Barton Elementary School in Redmond, Washington\nClara Barton Elementary School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nClara Barton Elementary School in Anaheim, California\nClara Barton Elementary School in The Bronx\nClara Barton Elementary School in Cherry Hill, New Jersey\nClara Barton Elementary School in Chicago\nClara Barton Elementary School in Corona, California\nClara Barton Elementary School in Oxford, Massachusetts\nClara Barton Elementary School in San Diego (now San Diego Cooperative Charter School)\nClara Barton Elementary School in Rochester NY\nClara Barton Elementary School in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania\nClara Barton Junior High School in Royal Oak, Michigan\nClara Barton High School for Health Professions in Brooklyn\nClara Barton House, a residence hall at Towson University, Towson, Maryland\nClara Barton Open School in Minneapolis\nClara Barton School, in Cabin John, Maryland, now the Clara Barton Community Center\nClara Barton School in Bordentown, New Jersey\nClara Barton School in Fargo, North Dakota\nClara Barton School in Philadelphia\nBarton Academy in Mobile, Alabama\n\n\n=== Streets ===\nClara Barton Road in Oxford, Massachusetts\nClara Barton Lane in Galveston, Texas\nBarton Boulevard in Rockledge, Florida\nClara Barton Drive in Albany, New York\nClara Barton Drive in Fairfax Station, Virginia\nClara Barton Parkway in Maryland\nClara Barton Street in Dansville, NY\nClara Barton Boulevard in Garland, TX\nClara Barton Circle in Sylacauga, AL\nClara Bartonstraat in Amsterdam\nBarton Road in Windsor, Maine\n\n\n=== Other ===\nBarton, a crater on Venus\nBarton Center for Diabetes Education, North Oxford, Massachusetts\nBarton County, Kansas\nBarton Hall, Iowa State University\nBarton House in Towson University\nBarton Towers, in Royal Oak, Michigan, on the former site of Clara Barton Junior High School\nBarton's Crossing, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, a homeless shelter\nClara Barton, a Norwegian Air Boeing 737-8MAX (part of Norwegian's \"Tailfin Heroes\" series)\nClara Barton, New Jersey, an unincorporated community located within Edison Township\nClara Barton Auditorium, United States Patent and Trademark Office, Alexandria, Virginia\nClara Barton Community Center, Cabin John, Maryland\nClara Barton District, a regional association of Unitarian Universalist Association member congregations\nClara Barton First Aid Squad, Edison, New Jersey\nClara Barton Home and Gardens, Johnstown, PA\nClara Barton Hospital and Clinics, Hoisington, Kansas\nClara Barton Memorial Forest in Lake Clear, New York, planted in 1925\nClara Barton Post Office Building, at 14 Walnut Street in Bordentown, New Jersey\nClara Barton Service Area, on the New Jersey Turnpike in Oldmans Township, New Jersey\nClara Barton Shelter, Stony Brook State Park, Dansville, New York\nClara Barton Tree, a giant sequoia tree in the Giant Forest, Sequoia National Park\nHeritage of Clara Barton, Edison, NJ, an Assisted Living Community\nLake Barton in Burke, Virginia\nThe House of Clara Barton at The King's College (New York City)\n\n\n== Other remembrances ==\n\nA stamp with a portrait of Barton and an image of the American Red Cross symbol was issued in 1948.Barton was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1973.Barton was featured in 1995 in a set of U.S. stamps commemorating the Civil War.In 2019, Barton was announced as one of the members of the inaugural class of the Government Executive magazine's Government Hall of Fame.Exhibits in the east wing of the third floor, 3 East, of the National Museum of American History are focused on the United States at war.

                "summary": "A stay-at-home order, safer-at-home order, movement control order (more common in Southeast Asia), or lockdown restrictions (in the United Kingdom) \u2013 also referred to by loose use of the terms (self-) quarantine, (self-) isolation, or lockdown \u2013 is an order from a government authority that restricts movements of a population as a mass quarantine strategy for suppressing or mitigating an epidemic or pandemic by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or for work in essential businesses. The medical distinction between such an order and a quarantine is that a quarantine is usually understood to involve isolating only selected people who are considered to be possibly infectious rather than the entire population of an area (though many colloquially refer to stay-at-home orders as quarantines.) In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Non-essential businesses are either closed or adapted to remote work. In some regions, it has been implemented as a round-the-clock curfew or called a shelter-in-place order, but it is not to be confused with a shelter-in-place situation.Similar measures have been used around the world, and, both officially and colloquially, different names have been used to refer to them, often only very loosely linked to the term's actual medical meaning.

                "content": "A stay-at-home order, safer-at-home order, movement control order (more common in Southeast Asia), or lockdown restrictions (in the United Kingdom) \u2013 also referred to by loose use of the terms (self-) quarantine, (self-) isolation, or lockdown \u2013 is an order from a government authority that restricts movements of a population as a mass quarantine strategy for suppressing or mitigating an epidemic or pandemic by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or for work in essential businesses.

When Italian authorities imposed a strict quarantine order in the northern part of the country, the media also used the term lockdown, which was used for Spain and France, as well as other countries around the world. Although it is not a technical term in public health or laws, the media continued to use lockdown to describe the actions taken by these governments. As the lockdowns were expanded to other countries, there was a shift in the definitions. Measures are less restrictive and other terms emerged in attempts to differentiate from the most restrictive measure in China.\n\nWhen the authorities in San Francisco Bay Area in the United States issued an order in March 2020 for residents to stay home to control the outbreak of COVID-19, they called it a shelter-in-place order. People were not familiar with it as the term shelter in place had been used in other emergency situations such as an active shooter which would require seeking a safe place to hide within the same building that the person already occupies until the situation is resolved. This caused confusion to the residents under the order on what exactly they are supposed to do.When Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced the state-wide order for California, superseding the Bay Area's order on March 19, he used the term stay-at-home order instead. Other US states started using the  term when they announced their statewide order. In a press conference, Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo criticized anyone using the term shelter-in-place for his stay-at-home order as it would invoke panic due to its association with active shooting situations or nuclear wars.\n\n\n=== North America ===\nIn the United States and Canada, the term lockdown has been widely used in emergency preparedness. A lockdown procedure requires immediate actions in hiding and locking all doors. Additional actions may be taken such as turning off lights and staying away from windows. Students in all grade levels around the country participate in lockdown drills on a regular basis.The word lockdown can also be associated with martial law to mean that people cannot leave their homes. In an attempt to avoid confusion, Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago made a comment about the stay-at-home order of Illinois by trying to differentiate it from a lockdown or a martial law.When states and counties across the United States issued an order to have residents remain home, they either called it a shelter-in-place order or stay-at-home order. It has been clarified that these orders are not lockdowns because residents are allowed to go in and out of their homes in limited circumstances. Some jurisdictions have determined that there is a legal or practical distinction between the terms \"stay-at-home\" and \"shelter-in-place\".\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Melbourne and Sydney, the term iso, shortened from self-isolation, is often colloquially used to refer to stay-at-home orders.\n\n\n== Legal matters ==\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe House of Commons laws which restricted movement and gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom were known as \"lockdown laws\". As health is mostly devolved, lockdown laws can differ between the nations of the UK. Lockdown regulations were made as emergency laws, powers passed onto the government by existing public health laws.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, United States constitutional law gives police power to the states. State governments can use this power within their own state. However, there is no clear authority for either the federal government or state governments to impose a lockdown between states. In term of legality of an order, the government must be able to prove that the order advances a \"compelling government interest\" and the actions are narrow enough to specifically achieve that goal and they are not unnecessarily broad.\n\n\n== Scope ==\nThe scope of lockdowns or stay-at-home orders can vary. There is no universal definition of what is deemed essential. Some orders allow residents to come out for outdoor activities. When residents come out of the house, the social distancing rules are typically applied. Some examples of essential services are banks, gas stations, grocery stores, medical offices, pharmacies, and restaurants (without dining in).In more restrictive measures in some locations, they require residents to carry paperwork (i.e., appropriate proof of qualifications) in order to go out and perform essential tasks (i.e., supply chain infrastructure, food delivery, healthcare, law enforcement, etc.).\n\n\n== Exceptions ==\nMost orders that restrict citizens from leaving their homes grants exceptions to certain persons or for certain situations that are available to all or most members of the population.\nSome of the exceptions that allow citizens to leave their homes include work, often limited to essential jobs, grocery shopping, certain types of errands, medical care, or dog walking. Some places have allowed leaving home for certain types of outdoor exercise and recreation and gatherings with limited numbers of people. Some places allow departure from one\u2019s home for any reason provided one does not establish close contact with others from outside their household or beyond the limited numbers of people the jurisdiction permits.\nWhen such exceptions are allowed, restrictions could be in place regarding the distance one can travel from their home or the hours one can leave home.\n\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nA 2021 study found that stay-at-home orders caused people to stay home.\n\n\n== COVID-19 pandemic ==\n\nNumerous stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, and similar restrictions were enforced globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Countries and territories around the world have enforced lockdowns of varying degrees. Some include total movement control while others have enforced restrictions based on time. Mostly, only essential businesses are allowed to remain open. Schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 63 countries, affecting approximately 47 per cent of the world's student population. The 2020 Singapore circuit breaker measures is an example of a lockdown due to COVID-19.On 12 June 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 79.5% of US adults surveyed during May 5\u201312 supported stay-at-home orders and nonessential business closures as government-mandated COVID-19 mitigation strategies.\n\n\n== References ==",

                "title": "Social distancing",
                "summary": "In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others (the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time) and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact (coughing or sneezing), direct physical contact (including sexual contact), indirect physical contact (such as by touching a contaminated surface), and airborne transmission (if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods). The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an  important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m (6 ft) in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term \"social distancing\" was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: \"And the leper in whom the plague is... he shall dwell alone; [outside] the camp shall his habitation be.\" During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on \"Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals\". In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a mass parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested using the term \"physical distancing\" instead of \"social distancing\" because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance (when there is no stay-at-home order) and by meeting via technology.",

During the 2009 swine flu pandemic the WHO described social distancing as \"keeping at least an arm's length distance from others, [and] minimizing gatherings\". During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC defined social distancing as \"remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately six feet or two meters) from others when possible\".Social distancing, combined with the use of face masks, good respiratory hygiene and hand washing, is considered the most feasible way to reduce or delay a pandemic.\n\n\n== Measures ==\n\nSeveral social distancing measures are used to control the spread of contagious illnesses. Research indicates that measures must be applied rigorously and immediately in order to be effective.\n\n\n=== Avoiding physical contact ===\n\nKeeping a set physical distance from each other and avoiding hugs and gestures that involve direct physical contact, reduce the risk of becoming infected during outbreaks of infectious respiratory diseases (for example, flu pandemics and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.) These distances of separation, in addition to personal hygiene measures, are also recommended at places of work. Where possible it may be recommended to work from home.The distance advised by authorities varies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the World Health Organization recommends that a distance of 1 m (3.3 ft) or more is safe. Subsequently, China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Lithuania and Singapore adopted a 1 m social distancing policy. South Korea adopted 1.4 m (4.6 ft). Australia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain adopted 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The United States adopted 6 ft (1.8 m), and Canada adopted 2 m (6.6 ft). The United Kingdom first advised 2 m, then on July 4, 2020 reduced this to \"one metre plus\" where other methods of mitigation such as face masks were in use.The WHO's one-metre recommendation stems from research into droplet-based transmission of tuberculosis by William F. Wells, which had found that droplets produced by exhalation, coughs, or sneezes landed an average of 3 ft (0.9 m) from where they were expelled. Quartz speculated that the U.S. CDC's adoption of 6 ft (1.8 m) may have stemmed from a study of SARS transmission on an airplane, published in The New England Journal of Medicine. When contacted, however, the CDC did not provide any specific information.Some have suggested that distances greater than 1\u20132 m (3.3\u20136.6 ft) should be observed. One minute of loud speaking can produce oral droplets with a load of 7 million SARS-CoV-2 virus per milliliter that can remain for more than eight minutes, a time-period during which many people could enter or remain in the area. A sneeze can distribute such droplets as far as 7 m (23 ft) or 8 m (26 ft). Social distancing is less effective than face masks at reducing the spread of COVID-19.Various alternatives have been proposed for the tradition of handshaking. The gesture of namaste, placing one's palms together, fingers pointing upwards, drawing the hands to the heart, is one non-touch alternative. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, this gesture was used by Prince Charles upon greeting reception guests, and has been recommended by the Director-General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Other alternatives include the popular thumbs up gesture, the wave, the shaka (or \"hang loose\") sign, and placing a palm on one's heart, as practiced in parts of Iran.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== School closures ===\n\nMathematical modeling has shown that transmission of an outbreak may be delayed by closing schools. However, effectiveness depends on the contacts children maintain outside of school. Often, one parent has to take time off work, and prolonged closures may be required. These factors could result in social and economic disruption.\n\n\n=== Workplace closures ===\nModeling and simulation studies based on U.S. data suggest that if 10% of affected workplaces are closed, the overall infection transmission rate is around 11.9% and the epidemic peak time is slightly delayed. In contrast, if 33% of affected workplaces are closed, the attack rate decreases to 4.9%, and the peak time is delayed by one week. Workplace closures include closure of \"non-essential\" businesses and social services (\"non-essential\" means those facilities that do not maintain primary functions in the community, as opposed to essential services).\n\n\n=== Canceling mass gatherings ===\n\nCancellation of mass gatherings includes sports events, films or musical shows. Evidence suggesting that mass gatherings increase the potential for infectious disease transmission is inconclusive. Anecdotal evidence suggests certain types of mass gatherings may be associated with increased risk of influenza transmission, and may also \"seed\" new strains into an area, instigating community transmission in a pandemic. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, military parades in Philadelphia and Boston may have been responsible for spreading the disease by mixing infected sailors with crowds of civilians. Restricting mass gatherings, in combination with other social distancing interventions, may help reduce transmission. A recent peer-reviewed study in the British Medical Journal (The BMJ) also suggested it as one of the key components of an effective strategy in reducing the burden of COVID-19.\n\n\n=== Travel restrictions ===\nBorder restrictions or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay an epidemic by more than two to three weeks unless implemented with over 99% coverage. Airport screening was found to be ineffective in preventing viral transmission during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada and the U.S. Strict border controls between Austria and the Ottoman Empire, imposed from 1770 until 1871 to prevent persons infected with the bubonic plague from entering Austria, were reportedly effective, as there were no major outbreaks of plague in Austrian territory after they were established, whereas the Ottoman Empire continued to suffer frequent epidemics of plague until the mid-nineteenth century.A Northeastern University study published in March 2020 found that \"travel restrictions to and from China only slow down the international spread of COVID-19 [when] combined with efforts to reduce transmission on a community and an individual level. ... Travel restrictions aren't enough unless we couple it with social distancing.\" The study found that the travel ban in Wuhan delayed the spread of the disease to other parts of mainland China only by three to five days, although it did reduce the spread of international cases by as much as 80 percent.\n\n\n=== Shielding ===\n\nShielding measures for individuals include limiting face-to-face contacts, conducting business by phone or online, avoiding public places and reducing unnecessary travel. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, shielding referred to special advisory measures put in place by the UK Government to protect those at the highest risk of serious illness from the disease. This included those with weakened immune systems (such as organ transplant recipients), as well as those with certain medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma. Until June 1, 2020, those shielding were strongly advised not to leave home for any reason at all, including essential travel, and to maintain a 2 m (6.6 ft) distance from anyone else in their household. Supermarkets quickly made priority grocery delivery slots available to those shielding, and the Government arranged for food boxes to be sent to those shielding who needed additional assistance, for example elderly people shielding on their own. This was gradually relaxed from June to allow shielders to spend more time outside, before being suspended indefinitely from August 1.\n\n\n=== Quarantine ===\n\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, approximately 8000 people were subjected to mandatory home quarantine and an additional 4300 were required to self-monitor for symptoms and make daily telephone contact with health authorities as a means of controlling the epidemic. Although only 58 of these individuals were eventually diagnosed with SARS, public health officials were satisfied that this measure assisted in preventing further spread of the infection. Voluntary self-isolation may have helped reduce transmission of influenza in Texas in 2009. Short and long-term negative psychological effects have been reported.\n\n\n== Stay-at-home orders ==\n\nThe objective of stay-at-home orders is to reduce day-to-day contact between people and thereby reduce the spread of infection During the COVID-19 pandemic, early and aggressive implementation of stay-at-home orders was effective in \"flattening the curve\" and provided the much needed time for healthcare systems to increase their capacity while reducing the number of peak cases during the initial wave of illness. It is important for public health authorities to follow disease trends closely to re-implement appropriate social distancing policies, including stay-at-home orders, if secondary COVID-19 waves appear.\n\n\n=== Cordon sanitaire ===\n\nIn 1995, a cordon sanitaire was used to control an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Kikwit, Zaire. President Mobutu Sese Seko surrounded the town with troops and suspended all flights into the community. Inside Kikwit, the World Health Organization and Zaire's medical teams erected further cordons sanitaires, isolating burial and treatment zones from the general population and successfully containing the infection.\n\n\n=== Protective sequestration ===\n\nDuring the 1918 influenza epidemic, the town of Gunnison, Colorado, isolated itself for two months to prevent an introduction of the infection. Highways were barricaded and arriving train passengers were quarantined for five days. As a result of the isolation, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic. Several other communities adopted similar measures.\n\n\n=== Other measures ===\nOther measures include shutting down or limiting mass transit and closure of sport facilities (community swimming pools, youth clubs, gymnasiums). Due to the highly interconnected nature of modern transportation hubs, a highly contagious illness can achieve rapid geographic spread if appropriate mitigation measures are not taken early. Consequently, highly coordinated efforts must be put into place early during an outbreak to proactively monitor, detect, and isolate any potentially infectious individuals. If community spread is present, more aggressive measures may be required, up to and including complete cessation of travel in/out of a specific geographic area.\n\n\n== History ==\nLeper colonies and lazarettos were established as a means of preventing the spread of leprosy and other contagious diseases through social distancing, until transmission was understood and effective treatments invented.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 1916 New York City polio epidemic ===\nDuring the 1916 New York City polio epidemic, when there were more than 27,000 cases and more than 6,000 deaths due to polio in the United States, with more than 2,000 deaths in New York City alone, movie theaters were closed, meetings were cancelled, public gatherings were almost non-existent, and children were warned not to drink from water fountains, and told to avoid amusement parks, swimming pools and beaches.\n\n\n=== Influenza, 1918 to present ===\n\nDuring the influenza pandemic of 1918, Philadelphia saw its first cases of influenza on 17 September. The city continued with its planned parade and gathering of more than 200000 people on 28 September and over the subsequent three days, the city's 31 hospitals became fully occupied. During the week ending 16 October, over 4500 people died. Social distancing measures were introduced on 3 October, on the orders of St. Louis physician Max C. Starkloff, more than two weeks after the first case. Unlike Philadelphia, St. Louis experienced its first cases of influenza on 5 October and the city took two days to implement several social distancing measures, including closing schools, theatres, and other places where people get together. It banned public gatherings, including funerals. The actions slowed the spread of influenza in St. Louis and a spike in cases and deaths, as had happened in Philadelphia, did not occur. The final death rate in St. Louis increased following a second wave of cases, but remained overall less than in other cities. Bootsma and Ferguson analyzed social distancing interventions in sixteen U.S. cities during the 1918 epidemic and found that time-limited interventions reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10\u201330%), and that the impact was often very limited because the interventions were introduced too late and lifted too early. It was observed that several cities experienced a second epidemic peak after social distancing controls were lifted, because susceptible individuals who had been protected were now exposed.School closures were shown to reduce morbidity from the Asian flu by 90% during the 1957\u20131958 pandemic, and up to 50% in controlling influenza in the U.S., 2004\u20132008. Similarly, mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures were associated with a 29% to 37% reduction in influenza transmission rates during the 2009 flu epidemic in Mexico.The 2009 swine flu pandemic caused social distancing to rise in popularity, most notably in Mexico, with the country's Ministry of Health advising people to avoid handshakes and kissing as ways of greeting people. A mandatory nationwide school closure enacted in Mexico, which lasted for 18 days from late April 2009 to early May 2009, was a form of social distancing aimed at reducing the transmission of Swine flu. A study from 2011 found the mandatory nationwide school closure and other forms of social distancing in Mexico were effective at reducing influenza transmission rates.During the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in the UK, in an article titled \"Closure of schools during an influenza pandemic\" published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, a group of epidemiologists endorsed the closure of schools to interrupt the course of the infection, slow the further spread and buy time to research and produce a vaccine. Having studied previous influenza pandemics including the 1918 flu pandemic, the influenza pandemic of 1957 and the 1968 flu pandemic, they reported on the economic and workforce effect school closure would have, particularly with a large percentage of doctors and nurses being women, of whom half had children under the age of 16. They also looked at the dynamics of the spread of influenza in France during French school holidays and noted that cases of flu dropped when schools closed and re-emerged when they re-opened. They noted that when teachers in Israel went on strike during the flu season of 1999\u20132000, visits to doctors and the number of respiratory infections dropped by more than a fifth and more than two fifths respectively.\n\n\n=== SARS 2003 ===\nDuring the SARS outbreak of 2003, social distancing measures were implemented, such as banning large gatherings, closing schools and theaters, and other public places, supplemented public health measures such as finding and isolating affected people, quarantining their close contacts, and infection control procedures. This was combined with the wearing of masks for certain people. During this time in Canada, \"community quarantine\" was used to reduce transmission of the disease with moderate success.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and related measures are emphasized by several governments as alternatives to an enforced quarantine of heavily affected areas. According to UNESCO monitoring, more than a hundred countries have implemented nationwide school closures in response to COVID-19, impacting over half the world's student population. In the United Kingdom, the government advised the public to avoid public spaces, and cinemas and theaters voluntarily closed to encourage the government's message.With many people disbelieving that COVID-19 is any worse than the seasonal flu, it has been difficult to convince the public\u2014particularly youth, and the anti vaxx community to voluntarily adopt social distancing practices. In Belgium, media reported a rave was attended by at least 300 before it was broken up by local authorities. In France, teens making nonessential trips are fined up to US$150. Beaches were closed in Florida and Alabama to disperse partygoers during spring break. Weddings were broken up in New Jersey and an 8 p.m. curfew was imposed in Newark. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania were the first states to adopt coordinated social distancing policies which closed down non-essential businesses and restricted large gatherings. Shelter in place orders in California were extended to the entire state on 19 March. On the same day Texas declared a public disaster and imposed statewide restrictions.These preventive measures such as social-distancing and self-isolation prompted the widespread closure of primary, secondary, and post-secondary schools in more than 120 countries. As of 23 March 2020, more than 1.2 billion learners were out of school due to school closures in response to COVID-19. Given low rates of COVID-19 symptoms among children, the effectiveness of school closures has been called into question. Even when school closures are temporary, it carries high social and economic costs. However, the significance of children in spreading COVID-19 is unclear. While the full impact of school closures during the coronavirus pandemic are not yet known, UNESCO advises that school closures have negative impacts on local economies and on learning outcomes for students.In early March 2020, the sentiment \"Stay Home\" was coined by Florian Reifschneider, a German engineer and was quickly echoed by notable celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and Busy Philipps in hopes of reducing and delaying the peak of the outbreak. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram also joined the campaign with similar hashtags, stickers and filters under #staythefhome, #stayhome, #staythefuckhome and began trending across social media. The website claims to have reached about two million people online and says the text has been translated into 17 languages.\n\n\n== Impact on mental health ==\n\nThere are concerns that social distancing can have adverse affects on participants' mental health. It may lead to stress, anxiety, depression or panic, especially for individuals with preexisting conditions such as anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, and paranoia. Widespread media coverage about a pandemic, its impact on economy, and resulting hardships may create anxiety. Change in daily circumstances and uncertainty about the future may add onto the mental stress of being away from other people.People with autism also suffer impact from social distancing. Adjusting to a new routine can be stressful for everyone within the spectrum but especially for children who have trouble with change. Children with autism may not know what is going on or might not be able to express their fears and frustrations. They also may need extra support to understand what's expected of them in some situations. The adjustment to a new situation can lead to challenging behavior uncharacteristic of the autistic individual's true character. In some countries and demographics, teenagers and young adults within the autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) receive support services including special education, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, speech services, and individual aides through school, but this can be a major challenge, particularly since many teenagers with ASD already have social and communication difficulties. Aggressive and self-injurious behaviors may increase during this time of fear and uncertainty.\n\n\n== Portrayal in literature ==\nIn his 1957 science fiction novel The Naked Sun, Isaac Asimov portrays a planet where people live with social distancing. They are spread out, miles from each other, across a sparsely-populated world. Communication is primarily through technology. A male and a female still need to engage in sex to make a baby, but it is seen as a dangerous, nasty chore. In contrast, when communication is through technology the situation is the reverse: there is no modesty, and casual nudity is frequent. The novel's point of departure is a murder: this seemingly idyllic world, in fact, has serious social problems.\n\n\n== Theoretical basis ==\nFrom the perspective of epidemiology, the basic goal behind social distancing is to decrease the effective reproduction number, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{e}}\n   or \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  , which in the absence of social distancing would equate to the basic reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary infected individuals generated from one primary infected individual in a population where all individuals are equally susceptible to a disease. In a basic model of social distancing, where a proportion \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   of the population engages in social distancing to decrease their interpersonal contacts to a fraction \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   of their normal contacts, the new effective reproduction number \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n   is given by:\nWhere the value of \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n   can be brought below 1 for sufficiently long, containment is achieved, and the number infected should decrease.For any given period of time, the growth in the number of infections can be modeled as:\nwhere:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{n}}\n   is the number of infected individuals after \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   incubation periods (5 days, in the case of COVID-19)Using COVID-19 as an example, the following table shows the infection spread given:\n\nA: No social distance mitigation\nB: 50% reduction in social interaction\nC: 75% reduction in social interaction\n\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nAn empirical study published in July 2020 in The BMJ (British Medical Journal) analyzed data from 149 countries, and reported an average of 13% reduction in COVID-19 incidence after the implementation of social distancing policies. Another study found that four social distancing interventions combined resulted in a reduction of the infection rate from 66% to less than 1%.Animals also practice social distancing to avoid disease.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCOVID-19 party\nHerd immunity\nLockdown\nPest house\nStay-at-home order\nNormalization of deviance \u2013 one reason people stop using effective prevention measures\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCDC Social Distancing\nAmerican Red Cross: How to Social Distance\nJohns Hopkins: Social and Physical Distancing",

Lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing COVID-19 community transmission, healthcare costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater stringency, and when not lifted too early.A study investigating the spread based on studies of the most common symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in France, Italy and the UK showed a marked decrease in new symptoms just a few days after the start of confinement on the countries (Italy and France) with the strongest lockdowns. Modelling on the United States pandemic suggested \"the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier\" and that the second wave would have been less severe had the lockdown lasted another two weeks.The stringent lockdown in Hubei in early 2020 proved effective at controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The relatively high number of cases and deaths in Sweden, which has kept much of its society open during the pandemic, when compared to its neighbours with comparable demographics Norway, Denmark and Finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to be at least partly attributable to this difference in policy. Similarly, modelling on Australian data concluded that achieving zero community transmission through a strict lockdown lowers healthcare and economic costs compared to less stringent measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early relaxation of restrictions have greater costs. This \"zero community transmission\" approach was adopted in Australia, and a strict four month lockdown in the state of Victoria during an outbreak in Melbourne, combined with other measures, averted a wider outbreak in the country in 2020. New Zealand and Vietnam also adopted a \"Zero-COVID\" strategy throughout 2020 that included targeted lockdowns.The emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 2021 has led some commentators to suggest that although lockdowns continue to reduce the spread of COVID-19, they have become less effective at containing it. Lockdowns in Australia and Vietnam in response to Delta outbreaks proved less effective at containment than previous lockdowns were against the spread of other variants.\n\n\n=== Voluntary versus mandatory restrictions ===\n\nOne study led by an economist at the University of Chicago found that involuntary lockdowns had little impact, with voluntary distancing making up nearly 90% of the fall in consumer traffic as people feared the virus itself. Similarly, a National Bureau of Economic Research study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just 5\u201310%. Another study from Yale University found that most social distancing was voluntary, driven primarily by \"media coverage of morbidity and mortality.\"On the other hand, some studies have argued that coercive measures probably decreased interactions, while accepting that most of the reduction may have been voluntary. One of those two studies, by Flaxman et al., has been criticized, among other things for having a country-specific adjustment factor, without which the model would predict a massive number of deaths for Sweden. One widely cited economic simulation asserting that shelter-in-place orders reduced total cases three-fold, however, held voluntary distancing constant. Another study found a 30% difference among border-counties where stay-at-home orders were imposed.Another study that compared the impact of 'less restrictive interventions' on the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden and South Korea, with mandatory stay-at home orders in 8 other countries, such as France and Spain, did not find evidence for greater disease control in the countries with more restrictions. However, the findings of the study have been questioned due to its numerous limitations, including the small sample size of countries.Some research has also found that an \"advisory\" approach is not adequate to control COVID-19 outbreaks. An analysis of an outbreak in northern Italy found that an effective reduction in community transmission occurred during a strict national lockdown, and that earlier less stringent measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a level low enough to reduce the spread of COVID-19.Since the beginning of the pandemic, Google has consistently collected data on movements, showing rapid declines in public activity long before legal restrictions were imposed. An April 2020 poll found that 93% of Americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal restrictions.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA review of 348 articles concluded there was unanimous acknowledgement of the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions in controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, current research also acknowledges high societal costs, though less than the costs of allowing the pandemic to spread without mitigation.\n\n\n=== Related to epidemiology ===\nThe consensus of epidemiological evidence supports generalised non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19.During the early stages of the pandemic in Europe and the United States, statistical modelling which advised that restrictions were needed to prevent a large number of deaths were used as the basis for lockdowns. This includes an Imperial College projection, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson. Despite some criticisms, academics defended the Imperial projection as fundamentally sound, while admitting the code was \"a buggy mess.\"A notable opponent of lockdowns has included Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who has frequently criticised the strategy. The Swedish government's approach has included minimal restrictions and has been controversial in part due to the relatively high death toll due to widespread transmission. However, the Swedish government began considering enacting a lockdown in early 2021.While arguing in August 2020 for the need for further lockdowns in the United States, physicians Ranu Dhillon and Abraar Karan argued for \"smarter lockdowns\" that impose restrictions on areas with high levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable populations in these locations to offset the economic costs.A number of medical experts signed the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020 which called for \"Focused Protection\" on high risk groups and minimal restrictions on the general population to achieve herd immunity through COVID-19 infection. However, the majority of medical experts and the WHO have strongly criticised this proposed strategy for its lack of scientific basis and for being unethical. The declaration has also attracted controversy over its funding and the authenticity of its signatures.\n\n\n=== Related to social impacts ===\nSome commentators have suggested that states' use of emergency powers to curb freedom of assembly and movement are authoritarian and may result in long-term democratic backsliding. Centralization of power by political leadership in Hungary, Poland, China and Cambodia in response to the pandemic have been cited as examples.Some researchers have noted that pandemic restrictions have come with mental health costs, compounded by those caused by the pandemic itself.Due to their closure, educational institutions worldwide transitioned to online learning. Teachers and faculty had to learn new ways to engage with students while in a pandemic. Examples of online teaching tools are podcasts, videos, and virtual classrooms.UN Women warned in a April 2020 report that pandemic restrictions exacerbate gender inequalities and have led to an increase in domestic violence. Many women are being forced to \u2018lockdown\u2019 at home with their abusers at the same time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible. For instance, in France there was a spike in cases of about 30% since the lockdown in March 2020.\n\n\n=== Related to economic impacts ===\nEconomists generally supported increased government funding for mitigation efforts, even at the cost of tolerating a very large economic contraction. They agreed that lockdowns should continue until the threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only the economic impact. There was a general agreement, at least in some economic circles, that \"severe lockdowns \u2014 including closing non-essential businesses and strict limitations on people's movement \u2014 are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less aggressive measures\".\nBoth the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published statements noting the impact of the lockdowns on livelihoods and food security, and Dr David Nabarro, WHO Special Envoy on COVID-19 stated in October 2020 that \"lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer\".\n\n\n=== Protests ===\n\nThere have also been a number of protests worldwide in opposition to lockdowns, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand. The motivations for and sizes of these protests have varied. Some have been spurred by the economic and social impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the pandemic, conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination.\n\n\n== Table of pandemic lockdowns ==\n\nIn the table pandemic lockdowns are defined as the shutdown of parts of the economy, due to non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures and are enforceable by law like:\n\nClosing of schools and kindergartens\nClosing of non-essential shops (shops and stores apart from food, doctors and drug stores)\nClosing of non-essential production\nCancellation of recreational venues and closing of public places\nCurfews\nStay-at-home orders and total movement controlThese measures are considered to have caused the COVID-19 recession in 2020.\nThe table does not contain:\n\nMeasures with smaller economic impacts like:\nborder closures\nsocial distancing measures and social movement restrictions\ntravel restrictions.\nOther non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures like mandatory quarantines after travel, self quarantine and social distancing measures\nAny measures which are voluntary rather than enforceable by lawThe pandemic has resulted in the largest number of shutdowns/lockdowns worldwide at the same time in history.. \nBy 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April \u2013 more than half of the world's population.Restrictions first began in China, with other countries in East Asia like Vietnam soon following it in implementing widespread containment measures. Much of Europe, North America and Africa took much longer to bring in tough measures. Lockdowns between and within nations are of varying stringency.By mid April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, with around 100 million in the Philippines and about 59 million in South Africa, while around 1.3 billion were under lockdown in India, which was the largest of all lockdowns.By the end of April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in various countries of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom; while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.\n\n\n== Variation by countries and territories ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCordon sanitaire (medicine)\nStay-at-home order\nCOVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines\nCOVID-19 lockdown in China\nCOVID-19 lockdown in India\nCOVID-19 lockdown in Italy\nMalaysian movement control order\nNational responses to the COVID-19 pandemic\nTimeline of the COVID-19 pandemic\nNew normal\nNormalization of deviance \u2013 one reason for disobedience of prevention measures\nPreventive action\nList of species named after the COVID-19 pandemic (including lockdowns)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Her family moved to the United States when she was a child so that her father could pursue a career as an orthopedic surgeon. Her family eventually settled in Smithfield, North Carolina. After finishing high school at age 16, she attended Dartmouth College. She became a writer and eventually editor-in-chief at The Dartmouth Review. After graduating from Dartmouth, she attended law school, graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law where she was on the editorial board of the Virginia Law Review. After law school, she clerked for Judge Paul Victor Niemeyer of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n\n\n== Legal career and political activism ==\n\n\n=== Political involvement ===\nIn 2008, Dhillon ran for a seat in the California Assembly. She lost the race, garnering 17% of the vote in the traditionally Democratic district. She ran for the California Senate in 2012, but was again unsuccessful. She served as the chair of the San Francisco Republican Party.Dhillon became a board member of the northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union after the September 11 attacks, in connection with her work on discrimination against Sikhs and other South Asians, and stayed on the board for three years. She has been heavily criticized by Republican activists for her ties to the ACLU, as well as her past contributions to the political campaigning of Kamala Harris.Dhillon was chosen to be a member of the California Republican Party's Board in 2013; she became a national committeewoman for the Republican National Committee in 2016. She also gave the opening prayer at the 2016 Republican National Convention.In early 2017, Dhillon interviewed to be the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Department of Justice. She was not nominated for the position.\nDhillon led the successful effort to remove Chad Mayes as the California State Assembly Republican caucus leader in August 2017.On July 11, 2019, Dhillon gave a speech at the President Trump's \"Social Media Summit\". Dhillon is a co-chair of Women for Trump. She has described Laura Ingraham as a \"long-time mentor.\"\n\n\n=== Lawsuits ===\nDhillon filed a lawsuit in April 2017 against University of California, Berkeley on behalf of the Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) and Young America's Foundation for freedom of speech issues, particularly the school cancelling Ann Coulter's speech quoting security reasons. The suit was settled in December 2018, with Dhillon arguing that it had forced the university to change its policies about controversial speakers, whereas the university maintained that it had already been following the amended policies before.In August 2017, James Damore, a former Google employee, hired Dhillon to be his lawyer against Google. Dhillon's firm has said it is also willing to represent more employees from Google who have similar stories to Damore. though Dhillon has already lost an appeal to the National Labor Relations Board. Damore's lawsuit against Google also was dismissed pursuant to a mandatory arbitration clause; however, the case continues without him.Conservative social media activist and journalist Andy Ngo retained Dhillon as his attorney after being assaulted on the street in Portland, Oregon, in June 2019. In June 2020, Dhillon filed suit on behalf of Ngo against antifa seeking $900,000 in damages for assault and emotional distress, and an injunction to prevent further harassment. The lawsuit cites Rose City Antifa, five other named defendants, and additional unknown assailants. It stems from multiple alleged attacks on Ngo in Portland during 2019, and accuses Rose City Antifa in particular of a \"pattern of racketeering activities\".\n\n\n==== Coronavirus pandemic ====\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Dhillon was behind many lawsuits challenging stay-at-home orders enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic to halt the spread of the virus. By June 2020, she had filed more than a dozen lawsuits against California.\nOn April 13 and 24, 2020, Dhillon filed suits against the state of California challenging its stay-at-home order. On behalf of two pastors in Riverside County, two parishioners in San Bernardino County, and seven businesses, including restaurants, a pet grooming shop, and a gondola company, she argued that their constitutional rights were being violated. Dhillon also filed lawsuits against the governors of New Jersey and Virginia over their restrictions on religious services. Most of these lawsuits were filed through the Center for American Liberty. Dhillon later argued that her lawsuits led to \"large sectors of California\u2019s economy opening up much sooner than the governor originally intended\", which in the assessment of The New York Times contributed to an \"alarming surge in cases\" in the second half of June. She criticized California's decision to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the 2020 election because of the public health risks of in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic. In July 2020, it was reported that she was suing state and local governments in California to keep nail salons and barbers open and to prevent the closure of schools during the pandemic.In May 2020, Dhillon criticized Virginia for requiring the use of face masks in public. She claimed that \"the masks don't work\" (contradicting the recommendation of health experts and the US CDC).In June 2020, she criticized California for requiring the use of face masks in public when individuals were unable to physically distance. She argued that people should be free to make their own decisions. She called on California to reopen its economy, even though coronavirus cases were surging. In July 2020, she said that she was considering filing a lawsuit over a restriction on singing or chanting in church to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.She filed a lawsuit against Hawaii when the state required that visitors to Hawaii undergo quarantine upon arrival. In July 2020, a judge ruled that the emergency mandate was a reasonable response to the public health threat posed by the coronavirus.\n\n\n=== Trump 2020 campaign legal adviser ===\nShe was a legal adviser on the Trump 2020 campaign. While the Trump campaign was making false and unsubstantiated voter fraud claims during the 2020 election (as the ballots were being counted), Dhillon said the campaign was hoping that the Supreme Court, including Trump-appointed justices such as Amy Coney Barrett, would help Trump win the presidency.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Harmeet Dhillon at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Harmeet Dhillon at Wikiquote\nOfficial website",

At this time, the vouchers had been used by less than 10% of the 5 million who could use it. There were calls by NSW opposition political parties for the scheme to be extended beyond its initial 30 June 2021 deadline to use the vouchers.

South Australia barred entry to anyone from the Northern Beaches, while Western Australia barred everyone coming from NSW. Measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 in Sydney were again tightened.

The local case also attended that hotel.As a result, on 31 March the 2021 Byron Bay Bluesfest was cancelled, for the second year, a day before it was to commence.

His wife also tested positive to COVID-19. Genomic testing provided a link to an overseas (US) acquired infection at the Park Royal in Darling Harbour. The new cases are believed to have been infectious while visiting at least 20 locations in Sydney from 30 April to 4 March.

On public transport and other indoor public venues masks remained mandatory. 13,768 COVID tests were undertaken in the 24 hours to 8:00 pm that day, but NSW recorded no locally acquired COVID-19 infections.

Both people landed in Sydney the previous day, and have travelled from southern Africa to Sydney via Doha, Qatar. The two people, who are fully vaccinated, entered isolation; 12 other travellers from southern Africa also entered quarantine for fourteen days, while about 260 other passengers and crew on the flight have been directed to isolate. On 29 November, two more passengers which arrived from southern Africa via Singapore tested positive for the Omicron variant.On 30 November, a positive case of the Omicron variant was recorded in Sydney. The person had visited southern Africa before arriving in Sydney prior to travel restrictions, and was subsequently active in the community in Sydney and the Central Coast. By 3 December, a cluster including Omicron variant cases had developed in western Sydney, in the suburbs of Regents Park and Villawood.\n\n\n==== December ====\nOn 5 December, new daily case numbers dropped to a low of 208.On 16 December, due to the spread of COVID-19 Omicron variant in the area, NSW Health urged the Newcastle community to consider deferring social events till after Christmas.On the afternoon of 16 December the Lunar Electric Music Festival in Newcastle, scheduled for December 18, was cancelled by a Public Health Order. This was done because the ongoing spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in that area was too high a risk.After falling as low as 208 then gradually rising, on 13 December new daily case numbers began to rise quickly again. By 18 December they had risen sharply for six consecutive days reaching what was then a new NSW state, and national, record of 2,566 new daily cases, before dropping slightly again to 2,501 on 19 December.By 22 December, great difficulties in finding rapid antigen tests (RAT) for COVID-19 became apparent.On 23 December, NSW single-dose vaccinations reached 95%, and 93.5% double dose, for the 16-years and older community and the NSW government announced that on 27 December until 27 January 2022, QR code check-ins would again be compulsory, including in hospitality and retail settings. Also, hospitality venues such as cafes, clubs, pubs and restaurants would return to a 1-person per 2 square metre rule indoors, but no density limit in outdoor settings.The same day, the state government also announced that they would source rapid antigen test (RAT) kits and distribute them for free.On 24 December, the states' new daily cases of COVID-19 rose to 6,288.\nAlso on 24 December, mask wearing indoors again became mandatory.On 25 December, there were no deaths recorded, and new daily cases of COVID-19 rose to 6,394.

Cases admitted to hospital were 520, with 55 in intensive care, 17 on ventilation, all more than the previous day.By 27 December, NSW pathology services processed more than 24 million PCR tests but, as in other states, resources were being strained by \"tourism testing\". Consequently, on 29 December the NSW Health Department asked that people getting tested to travel interstate for holidays avoid going to COVID testing sites unnecessarily as it was unlikely they would get test results within 72 hours. If travelling to Qld, this would be after that states' 1 January  2022 changes to test requirements became effective and only a RAT test needed.Priority for getting a PCR test was then given to those who:\n\u2022 had COVID-19 symptoms or  \u2013 a positive rapid antigen test\n\u2022 were a household contact of a confirmed case\n\u2022 had been in a venue, for example a club, where there had been high transmission \n\u2022 had been in a setting with vulnerable people which was experiencing an outbreak, such as an aged care home\nOn 28 December there were 3 more deaths, raising the state total to 658, and new case numbers jumped by about 85% in 24 hours to 11,201 from 6,062 on 27 December.On 30 December there were another 6 deaths raising the state total to 665.

The season is currently expected to start on February 18, 2023.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 2020 XFL season was cut short following five weeks of play in March 2020, as a result of immediate and prolonged stay-at-home orders and prohibitions on large gatherings imposed in an unsuccessful effort to stop the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. XFL parent company Alpha Entertainment declared bankruptcy in response to the measures\u2014most of which would not be fully lifted until vaccines were made available and widespread in spring 2021\u2014on April 13, 2020. The assets of the league were sold to Johnson, Garcia and Cardinale on August 3, 2020.During the course of the 2021 offseason, the XFL's new ownership group began discussions with the Canadian Football League regarding a potential partnership; these discussions collapsed in July, leading the league to cancel its planned 2022 season.On December 2, 2021, it was revealed on Dany Garcia's Instagram page that the 2023 XFL season would start on its traditional date of the Saturday after Super Bowl LVII (as it had in 2020 and 2001), February 18, 2023. A player combine is scheduled for June 18, 2022 and training camps would begin January 8, 2023.McMahon fired Commissioner Oliver Luck shortly before the bankruptcy; the league was left in the stewardship of Jeffrey Pollack during the transition to new ownership until Pollack resigned and was succeeded by former Buffalo Bills President Russ Brandon in November 2021.\n\n\n== References ==",

The page quickly grew to 100,000+ users in less than a week and then was removed from Facebook for violations of terms of service. The group then setup 53 Facebook groups named \"AR2\" to run protests at the capitol of every state (plus Los Angeles and Chicago). This page and the many groups were led by Naperville, IL native Josh Ellis. On April 30, 2020, at 11pm CST all 53 groups were deleted simultaneously from Facebook for violating terms and conditions. Due to the widespread notoriety and media coverage of the May 1 planned protest many other groups started smaller protests prior to the date.One of the first protests to take place was in Michigan on April 15, 2020. It was organized via a Facebook group called \"Operation Gridlock\", which was created by the Michigan Conservative Coalition. A spokesman for the Michigan Conservative Coalition encouraged groups in other states to copy the Operation Gridlock wording and templates. Protesters in numerous other states said they were inspired by Michigan, and they used Michigan's material on their own websites, Facebook groups, and Reddit pages to promote their protests. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer falsely claimed that the Michigan Freedom Fund was a party to this event and that it is funded in part by the DeVos family, but a spokesman said the family had nothing to do with the protests.The Trump campaign declined to answer whether it was directly involved with organizing the protest in Michigan, but key protest organizers who did identify themselves were Meshawn Maddock, the wife of Republican state representative Matt Maddock and a member of the national advisory board for Women for Trump, and Marian Sheridan, who serves as a vice chair on the Michigan Republican Party, both founding members of Michigan Conservative Coalition. The protest in Washington State was organized by a county Republican Party, and speakers included three Republican state legislators. FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group associated with the Tea Party movement, published a \"#ReOpenAmerica Planning Guide\".Protesters opposed the shelter-in-place orders in their states for various reasons. Many said they want businesses reopened so they can go back to work. Many others displayed pro-Trump banners, signs, and MAGA hats. Still others insisted the lockdowns were a violation of their constitutional rights. One militia leader told a reporter, \"Re-open my state or we will re-open it ourselves.\" The anger driving the protests was called \"both real and manufactured\", with conservative groups engaging in astroturfing via centralized organization backed by anonymous donors.The reopen protests have generally been small, with protester numbers ranging from a few dozen to the low hundreds; the first protest in Michigan drew twenty thousand protestors, as estimated by the state police. Protesters included mainstream Republicans, but also far-right groups including Proud Boys and armed militia movement supporters. A large number of \"anti-vax\" advocates have attended, and some have been the organizers of local protests. Ben, Chris and Aaron Dorr, three guns-rights activist brothers, are the organizers of protests in several midwestern states.Historians have noted that the protests are similar to those who grew tired of restrictions from the 1918 pandemic.After the murder of George Floyd on May 25, many of the Facebook groups created to organize protests over COVID-19 expanded their focus to attack the protests organized by Black Lives Matter\n\n\n== By state ==\n\n\n=== Midwest ===\n\n\n==== Illinois ====\n\nOn May 1, thousands of anti-lockdown protesters displaying the Confederate Flag, a sign written in German that read \"work will set you free\", Nazi symbols and signs with slogans like \"Give me liberty or give me COVID-19\" gathered for a \"Re-open Illinois\" rally in Springfield organized by \"American Revolution 2.0.\" Protesters and counter-protesters met in Chicago and Springield where two arrests were made for disorderly conduct.\n\n\n==== Indiana ====\n\nApproximately 250 people gathered in front of the Governor's Mansion in Indianapolis on April 18, 2020, to protest Governor Eric Holcomb's stay at home order.

The protesters called for the governor to appear and explain himself, and said they were willing to be arrested if necessary.\n\n\n==== Michigan ====\n\nMichigan was the site of the largest of the \"re-open\" protests. The first confirmed case of coronavirus was recognized in Michigan on March 10, 2020. On April 15, the day of the protest, Michigan had at least 28,059 confirmed cases\u2014the third highest number of cases in the United States\u2014and 1,921 deaths had been attributed to the disease in the state. Metropolitan Detroit had been pronounced a \"hot spot\". Initial state actions to limit spread of the virus included closure of all K-12 schools, closure of bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. On March 24 a statewide stay-at-home order was issued which limited non-essential travel and ordered all non-essential business services and operations to close. The order was extended in early April with additional restrictions included.On April 15, 2020, as estimated by the state police, 20,000 people took part in a protest they called \"Operation Gridlock\" in the area surrounding the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing. Most protestors remained in their vehicles, jamming the streets around the capitol building, although around 150 protested on the capitol lawn. The protest lasted eight hours. The protest caused delays during a shift-change at Sparrow Hospital. Police described the protesters as respectful, with most trying to maintain social distancing; no arrests were made.Protesters complained of loss of work and other economic hardship caused by the state government's coronavirus response. Some felt that if they were not sick, that they should have the freedom to continue with their normal routine. Others claimed violation of their civil liberties or expressed opposition to Governor Gretchen Whitmer's administration. Some protesters lived in more rural areas of Michigan that had not seen as many coronavirus cases as the cities of Detroit or Flint.On April 30, a second protest organized as part of the \"American Revolution 2.0\" national protest occurred when hundreds of protesters, many carrying firearms, gathered at the Michigan Capitol. Many protesters were able to enter the building. The demonstration had assistance organizing  locally by the conservative group American Patriot Council . The protest was much smaller than the one on April 15, but the show of firearms and the violent tone of some of the signs indicated that things were changing. Some protesters compared the Governor to Adolf Hitler while children danced in masks of Donald Trump and Barack Obama on the steps of the Capitol. Governor Whitmer extended the state of emergency regardless.On May 14, more armed protesters, organized by the group Michigan United for Liberty, gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol. The organization's Facebook group was deleted over death threats against Governor Whitmer and a fight broke out over a doll tied to a noose at the protest. The Michigan Legislature closed its scheduled session to avoid the possibility of another armed confrontation inside the chamber.On May 20, seven hairdressers were ticketed for cutting hair on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol, for allegedly violating their licenses.

Sundgaard was subsequently fired for \"ethics violations.\"On May 11, a few dozen people gathered outside Albert Lea City Hall for a \"prayer protest\" in response to the pandemic lockdown.On May 23, more than 200 attended what was supposed to be the reopening of a tavern in Albany. After attorneys obtained an injunction to prevent the reopening, the crowd became a protest. Attendees harassed a reporter for wearing a mask and intentionally coughed in public while not wearing masks.On June 25, a couple wore Nazi flags in lieu of masks on their faces while shopping at a grocery store in Marshall.\n\n\n==== North Dakota ====\n\nEven though Governor Doug Burgum did not issue a stay-at-home order, about 150 protesters gathered outside the North Dakota State Capitol in Bismarck to demand the state government reopen concert venues, movie theaters, gyms, nail salons, massage parlors and barber shops.\n\n\n==== Ohio ====\n\nProtests began in Ohio on April 9, with about 75 gathering outside of the Ohio Statehouse to protest Governor Mike DeWine's stay at home order.

The next day, April 18, the protests grew to hundreds. Protesters carried signs with slogans lamenting the loss of liberties for the sake of safety, as well as signs critical of state officials, and demanded that the state be immediately reopened.The governor said that he would not interfere with the protests, provided they adhered to social distancing guidelines. Photographs from the protests on April 18 indicated that not all protesters had been honoring those guidelines; however, many of them stayed in cars.On May 2, a small group of anti-lockdown protesters in Bexley patrolled the streets outside the private residence of Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton. The Bexley City Council briefly considered a local ordinance banning protests outside Acton's home, but ultimately decided against the measure.\n\n\n==== Wisconsin ====\n\nSeveral thousand people gathered at the state capitol in Madison on April 24 to protest the state's \"Safer at Home\" rules requiring social distancing and the closure of nonessential businesses.

Speaker Scott Bedke ultimately allowed them to fill every seat despite social distancing rules.On March 6, 2021, more than a hundred protesters gathered outside the Idaho Sate Capitol for a \"burn the mask\" event organized by the husband of Idaho state representative Dorothy Moon and others.\n\n\n==== Nevada ====\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered on April 18 in Carson City at the Nevada State Capitol and on Carson Street chanting \"End the shutdown\", \"One nation under God\", and \"Recall Sisolak\".\n\n\n==== New Mexico ====\n\nA small group of anti-lockdown protesters gathered at Civic Plaza in Albuquerque for an Operation Gridlock event on April 24. Small protests also took place in Santa Fe and Farmington.\n\n\n==== Oregon ====\n\nDozens of protesters circled the Oregon State Capitol in Salem in their vehicles on April 17, 2020. 200 people gathered outside City Hall in Redmond. The \"Re-Open Oregon\" rally was held on May 1 and 2. On December 21, during an anti-lockdown protest, about 300 demonstrators attempted to storm the Oregon State Capitol, but they were warded off by responding officers with the Oregon State Police. At the time, the State Capitol was hosting a special legislative session closed to the public. The group included members of far-right groups such as Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer.\n\n\n==== Utah ====\n\nHundreds protested on the lawn at Salt Lake City's Washington Square on Saturday, April 18. The day before the protest, according to a police affidavit, Mayor Erin Mendenhall was threatened by a man who stated, \"The mayor needs to open up the city. If she doesn't, she'll be forcibly removed from office. There's a protest tomorrow and if things don't change, a civil war is coming, and the police can't stop me.\" The man was arrested and booked for making a terroristic threat and electronic communication harassment.\n\n\n==== Washington ====\n\nThe Kitsap County Republican Party coordinated an event \"Hazardous Liberty! Defend the Constitution!\" called in Olympia on April 19. The Olympia event was attended by more than two thousand people. Speakers included three Republican state legislators.On April 26, dozens of boaters in Lake Union protested the state ban on recreational fishing that is part of Gov.

The next day he reacted to the protests against social restrictions by encouraging the protests, tweeting \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" and \"LIBERATE MINNESOTA!\" Trump has continued to defend the protesters by saying; \"They seem very responsible to me\" and \"These are people expressing their views.\" Stephen Moore, a right-wing member of his economic council, was criticised for comparing the protesters to Rosa Parks. Maia Niguel Hoskin of Vox claimed that \"ignorance, privilege, and anti-black racism\" was a main factor behind the protests.On April 20, 2020, Facebook announced that it was blocking events and messages from anti-quarantine protest groups \"when gatherings do not follow the health parameters established by the government and are therefore unlawful\". The governors of New Jersey and Nebraska say they have not asked Facebook to take down the posts. Despite Facebook apparently acting on its own volition, Donald Trump, Jr. claimed Facebook was \"colluding with state governments to quash free speech\".\n\n\n=== State governments ===\nGovernor Jay Inslee (D-WA) accused the president of \"fomenting domestic rebellion\" with his \"LIBERATE!\" tweets, saying, \"The president's statements this morning encourage illegal and dangerous acts. He is putting millions of people in danger of contracting COVID-19.\" On This Week two days later, Inslee said the president's call to ignore his own team's guidelines was \"schizophrenic\".When asked if there is a fundamental right to go to work, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo encouraged protesters to get an essential job.North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper responded to the first protest in his state, saying, \"Some people want to completely obliterate these restrictions. It would be a catastrophe. The numbers are very clear that the interventions that we've entered into\u2014social gatherings, limitations on bars and restaurants, the stay at home order\u2014those kinds of things are working.\"\n\n\n=== General public ===\nOn April 16, Pew Research polls indicated that 32% of Americans worried state governments would take too long to re-allow public activities, while 66% feared the state restrictions would be lifted too quickly.Many lawmakers and other public figures have condemned the protests as unsafe and ill-advised. Republican Mike Shirkey, the Majority Leader of the Michigan Senate, called the protesters in his state \"a bunch of jackasses.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nProtests over responses to the COVID-19 pandemic\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on politics\nStrikes during the COVID-19 pandemic\nU.S. state and local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic\nOperation Warp Speed\nOpen the States\nRight-wing antiscience\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDaly, Diana (May 6, 2020). \"An ethnographer tries to understand the anti-lockdown protests erupting across the US\".

These speeches started as organized meetings between McKinley and delegations from all over the nation. Although it was expensive for the campaign to bring these delegations, all in all, this idea became a good strategy because of the publicity it generated. In addition, due to the fact that McKinley's campaign chose those who would travel as part of the delegation, it was possible to make those who spoke portray McKinley positively.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRose Garden strategy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Front-Porch Campaign for Citizen Dole.

Most of the games use Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition. Seasons of the show alternate between major campaigns, featuring a returning cast of players with fifteen or more episodes, and side quests, with rotating guests and lasting ten episodes or fewer.\n\n\n== History ==\nDimension 20 originated as a production for Dropout, a streaming service aimed at delivering content with R-rated material or unusual formatting which launched in 2018. Dimension 20 was among the shows listed for the service when it was first unveiled. Mulligan cited a number of existing tabletop shows as inspiration for Dimension 20, including NADDPOD (Not Another D&D Podcast), The Adventure Zone and Critical Role. The format for the show, with distinct arcs based on different settings, was determined early on in the show's development.The show debuted in 2018 with Fantasy High as the first campaign presented. The strong fan response from the first season resulted in Fantasy High being renewed for a live season, known as Fantasy High: Sophomore Year. Episodes of Fantasy High: Sophomore Year were streamed live on Twitch, as opposed to pre-recorded, edited, and uploaded to YouTube. The season concluded with a two-part finale titled \u201cSpring Break! I Believe in You!\u201d, which was streamed remotely. Through social media, the Dimension 20 team confirmed that they have plans to continue the story of \u201cThe Bad Kids\u201d with a third season in the Fantasy High series.\nIn January 2020, major layoffs took place at CollegeHumor, including much of the cast. The show nevertheless continued production remotely as California\u2019s Stay at Home orders were put into effect. \nOn May 24, 2021, Brennan Lee Mulligan announced in a video on Dropout that Dimension 20 and other CollegeHumor projects would resume production in-person and in-studio, adhering to COVID safety guidelines set by SAG-AFTRA and other film guilds and production unions.\n\n\n== Format ==\nDimension 20 usually features its main cast as players (Ally Beardsley, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Brian Murphy, Zac Oyama, and Siobhan Thompson), but for alternating seasons nicknamed \"side quests,\" the show invites guests to play for that season. As of June 2021, Dimension 20 has had seven side quests: Escape from the Bloodkeep (featuring Matthew Mercer of Critical Role, and Erika Ishii of Vampire: The Masquerade- LA by Night), Tiny Heist (featuring the cast of The Adventure Zone), Pirates of Leviathan (featuring Marisha Ray of Critical Role, with Mercer returning), Mice & Murder (featuring many CollegeHumor alum), Misfits and Magic (the first campaign to feature a guest DM, Aabria Iyengar, with Brennan Lee Mulligan as a player), The Seven, and Shriek Week. Brennan Lee Mulligan is usually the Dungeon Master, but beginning with the ninth season, Misfits & Magic, the show adopted rotating Dungeon Masters. The change was announced via a trailer with an attached FAQ document.\n\n\n=== Campaigns ===\nThe campaigns use the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition system with Brennan Lee Mulligan as the Dungeon Master (DM) unless otherwise stated. The DM also creates house rules that make the game run differently from the normal system.\n\n\n=== Supplementary shows ===\nCollegeHumor publishes additional videos that discuss elements of role-playing (Adventuring Academy) or specifics about the first season (Dimension 20 Fantasy High Extra Credit). These are released via YouTube.\nDropout also features a Q&A and talkback show tied to various seasons of Dimension 20 called Adventuring Party. The first four seasons centered around A Crown of Candy, Pirates of Leviathan, The Unsleeping City: Chapter II, and Mice and Murder were all filmed remotely and aired live following the release of the episode of Dimension 20 aired that week, where fans submit questions that Mulligan and the cast will answer. Once filming resumed in The Dome, however, the format changed to that of a commentary talkback show pre-recorded after the episode was filmed.\n\n\n=== One-Shots ===\nDropout has released multiple one-shot adventures additional to their full length campaigns, such as Dimension 20: Fantasy High! Live! at The Bell House, Fantasy High LIVE at RTX Austin, Boys' Night! (Roll20Con) , and College Visit (RTX @ Home Live) . \n\n\n== Reception ==\nComic Book Resources warmly received the show, describing it as \"among the best of its kind\". The review highlighted the arc based format, which keeps the story fast paced and allows the rotation of new players and voices in the space. The show has also been praised for its positive LGBTQ representation, with multiple characters exploring their sexualities during the two seasons of Fantasy High.\n\n\n== References ==",

The country entered a general nationwide lockdown on 23 March 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, which was lifted on 15 May.The state of Victoria, particularly its capital city of Melbourne, the country's second most populous city with five million residents, entered an extended lockdown on 7 July 2020 in response to a rapidly growing community outbreak. Initial measures included the closure of all non-essential services, including retail entertainment venues and gyms. Restaurant and bar establishments were permitted to open in take-away and delivery capacities only. Schools and childcare facilities were also ordered to close. Face coverings were made mandatory as of 23 July 2020, with a fine of $200 AUD for non-compliance to those above 12 years of age, although formal exemptions could be acquired. Initially scheduled to last six weeks, restrictions were tightened further on 2 August after cases continued to grow, including a ban on travel further than a five kilometre radius from place of residence, a nighttime curfew of 8pm to 5am, a one-hour limit on outdoor exercise, a one-person per day limit on shopping for essentials, and public gatherings limited to a maximum of two people. Restrictions were progressively eased as the case rate declined, and were completely lifted on 28 October. With a total duration of 112 days, the Victorian lockdown was at the time the longest continuous period of COVID-19 lockdown globally as of October 2020. The lockdown resulted in the state recording zero active cases of COVID-19 in November 2020.\nVictoria entered its fourth lockdown on 28 May 2021 in response to an outbreak of the Delta variant. Originally scheduled for seven days, the lockdown was extended to two weeks and lifted on 10 June. Another outbreak of the Delta variant saw Greater Sydney enter lockdown on 26 June 2021, scheduled to last until 16 July, but extended by two weeks on 14 July then until 28 August and the end of September 2021.  Combined with snap lockdowns declared in Brisbane, Perth, and Darwin, more than 12 million people were in lockdown across Australia on 29 June 2021.Brief \"snap lockdowns\" in response to new clusters, particularly of the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants, have been implemented at various times across the country.Metropolitan Melbourne's 6th lockdown is over, but it is the city with the longest amount of time spent in lockdown in the world.\n\n\n=== Austria ===\n\nIn November 2021, Austria introduced lockdown measures, but only for unvaccinated people, in response to an increase in cases and low vaccination rate. The country introduced a lockdown for all citizens a few days later, making it the first European country to reintroduce such measures in the winter of 2021.\n\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n\nOn 22 March 2020, Bangladesh announced a ten-day lockdown, starting from 26 March. The lockdown in the country was extended several times to 30 May.\n\n\n=== Cambodia ===\n\nOn 15 April 2021, Cambodia's government enacted a strict stay-at-home order across the entirety of Phnom Penh and Ta Khmau in response to the country's largest COVID-19 outbreak of the pandemic. Certain districts were declared as \"red zones\", banning people from leaving their homes except for medical emergencies. Sihanoukville also entered a lockdown on 24 April.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nOn 25 January 2020, the first identified presumptive case in Canada was a 56-year-old male who had travelled to Wuhan, China, before returning to Toronto on 22 January. Canada issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to China due to the outbreak, including a regional travel advisory to avoid all travel to the province of Hubei.\nFederal health officials stated that the risk in Canada was low.\nOn 26 January 2020, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam tweeted, \"There is no clear evidence that this virus is spread easily from person to person. The risk to Canadians remains low.\"Three days later, on 29 January, Dr. Tam told Canadians that \"It's going to be rare, but we are expecting cases.\"On 1 February, the position of the prime minister and the administration remained that it would be discriminatory to exclude travellers from China, the source (and, at the time, still the epicentre) of the disease.During March, Canadian provinces implemented lockdowns in response to COVID-19.\nOntario, the country's most populous province, had its first provincewide lockdown starting on 26 December 2020. The lockdown was strengthened with a stay-at-home order effective 14 January 2021, and reopened on a regional basis starting 10 February. As a result of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the province caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants, the government of Ontario once again announced a four-week provincewide shutdown effective 3 April. This shutdown was once again strengthened with another 28-day stay-at-home order starting 8 April, in order to quickly combat the urgent crisis in the province's hospital capacity being caused by the variants.The city of Toronto, Ontario is considered to have the longest continuous COVID-19 lockdown of any major city in the world.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nChina was the first country to enforce the quarantine and lockdown of cities and later whole provinces in late January 2020. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said he personally authorized the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning on 23 January. Although such measures are a very old tool of epidemic control, their use at the scale of a large city such as Wuhan or the even larger scale of provinces was controversial among experts at the time, with questions about their effectiveness and their ethics. Some public health experts, while not always condemning the measure, raised the issue of the inevitable psychological toll such measures would have. An ex-World Health Organization (WHO) official who headed the organization's Western Pacific Region during the SARS outbreak said that \"the containment of a city [hadn't] been done in the history of international public health policy\". The WHO called the decision to quarantine Wuhan \"new to science\". By early April, all lockdowns had ended or relaxed to a certain degree as the cases started to dwindle and the outbreak had come under control.\n\n\n=== Denmark ===\n\n\n=== Fiji ===\n\nOn 19 March 2020, Fiji confirmed its first case in Lautoka. In response, the Government of Fiji ordered the lockdown of the city on 20 March with closures of all schools and non-essential services all over the country. On 3 April 2020, Fiji's capital, Suva, went into lockdown after confirming two new cases. More than 300,000 residents were confined to their homes and all non-essential services in the city was closed for two weeks.On 19 April 2021, Nadi and Lautoka went into lockdown after recording its first community transmission in one year. As cases continues to escalate in its second wave, the government has ruled out any possibility of a nationwide lockdown but would focus on targeted lockdowns of communities instead.\n\n\n=== France ===\n\nFrom 17 March 2020, all people in France were required to complete and carry an exemption form to leave their homes and can be fined for non-essential journeys. Essential journeys include shopping for food, travelling to and from work, accessing healthcare, and exercising within 1 km of the home for up to 1 hour. Police around the country had set up road blocks to check people who were out and about had good reason and that their exemption declarations were in order. These measures were lifted on 11 May 2020, with remaining restrictions on travel further than 100 km away from one's residence. The latter restrictions were lifted on 2 June 2020.\nOn 28 October, president Emmanuel Macron announced a second lockdown until at least 1 December 2020. During this second lockdown, schools remain open and more industries can keep operating (construction, public services...). Like the first lockdown, citizens need to sign their certificates to can go around within 1 km up to hour per day. Fines are 135 euros the 1st time, 200 euros for 2 times within 15 days and 3750 euros and 6 months jail sentence for 3 times within 30 days.\n\n\n=== Ghana ===\n\n\n=== India ===\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n\n\n==== Large-scale social restrictions ====\n\n\n==== Community Activities Restrictions Enforcement ====\n\n\n=== Iran ===\n\nThere were night/day curfews put periodically in place in yellow and orange coded regions.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\n\nOn 12 March, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities in Ireland until the end of August. On 27 March, Varadkar announced a national stay-at-home order for at least two weeks; the public were ordered to stay at home in all circumstances. All non-essential shops and services, including all pubs, bars, hotels and nightclubs closed and all public and private gatherings of any number of people was banned. The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police) were given power to enforce the measures, which were repeatedly extended until 18 May.A roadmap to easing restrictions in Ireland that included five stages was adopted by the government on 1 May 2020 and subsequently published online. The fourth and final phase of easing COVID-19 restrictions in Ireland was initially scheduled to take place on 20 July, but was repeatedly postponed until 31 August at the earliest.On 7 August, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin announced a regional lockdown and a series of measures for counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly following significant increases of COVID-19 cases in the three counties, which came into effect from midnight and will remain in place for two weeks.On 15 September, the Government announced a medium-term plan for living with COVID-19 that included five levels of restrictions.All non-essential businesses and services closed and all public and private gatherings of any number of people was banned again on 21 October following the Government's announcement to move the entire country to Level 5 lockdown restrictions for six weeks until 1 December. On 27 November, the Government agreed to ease restrictions from 1 December.A third wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland on 21 December. The Government acted swiftly and on 22 December, Level 5 lockdown restrictions with a number of adjustments were announced, which came into effect from Christmas Eve until 12 January 2021 at the earliest.All non-essential businesses and services closed and all public and private gatherings of any number of people was banned again on 31 December (New Year's Eve) following the Government's announcement to move the entire country to full Level 5 lockdown restrictions from 30 December until 31 January 2021 at the earliest, in an attempt to get a third surge in cases of COVID-19 under control. On 26 January, the Government extended the Level 5 lockdown restrictions until 5 March. On 23 February, the Government extended the Level 5 lockdown restrictions for another six weeks until 5 April (Easter Monday) at the earliest, while its new revised Living with COVID-19 plan was published.On 30 March, the Government announced a phased easing of restrictions from Monday 12 April. On 29 April, the Government announced a reopening plan for the country throughout May and June from 10 May, with a further reopening planned announced on 31 August that would see all remaining COVID-19 restrictions in Ireland eased by 22 October.After a fourth wave of COVID-19 arrived in Ireland in October, the Government published on 19 October a revised plan for the easing of restrictions, with nightclubs allowed to reopen, however the continued use of masks, vaccine certificates and social distancing measures would remain in place until at least February 2022. On 3 December, the Government reintroduced a series of measures that would commence from 7 December amid concerns of the Omicron variant, with nightclubs to close, indoor cultural and sporting events to operate at 50% capacity and a maximum of four households allowed to meet indoors.The Omicron variant caused a fifth wave of COVID-19 to arrive in late December and early January 2022, with record levels of cases reported over the Christmas and New Year period. As cases began to fall sharply, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin announced on 21 January the easing of almost all COVID-19 restrictions, with the requirements of vaccine certificates and social distancing to end, restrictions on household visits and capacity limits for indoor and outdoor events to end, nightclubs to reopen and pubs and restaurants to resume normal trading times, while rules on isolation and the wearing of masks would remain. Remaining restrictions were agreed to be removed from 28 February, with mask wearing in schools, indoor retail settings and on public transport to be voluntary, restrictions in schools to end and testing to be scaled back.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nOn 9 March 2020, the government of Italy under Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a national quarantine, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances, in response to the growing pandemic of COVID-19 in the country. Additional lockdown restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. This followed a restriction announced on the previous day which affected sixteen million people in the whole region of Lombardy and in fourteen largely-neighbouring provinces in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont and Marche, and prior to that a smaller-scale lockdown of ten municipalities in the province of Lodi and one in the province of Padua that had begun in late February. The restrictions were loosened in May 2020.\nThe lockdown measures, despite being widely approved by the public opinion, were also described as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the republic. Nevertheless, Article 16 of the Constitution states that travel restrictions may be established for reasons of health or security.\n\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n\nMalaysia introduced the nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020, which was initially announced to last to 14 April but was extended several times. The MCO prohibited mass gatherings, movement within the country, and most industries and all education institutions were ordered to close. Extended Movement Control Orders (EMCO) were implemented in areas where suspected superspreading events or widespread transmission had occurred. Royal Malaysian Police were mobilized to enforce restrictions. These restrictions were later eased under the \"Conditional MCO\" (CMCO), which maintained some restrictions on assembly and movement but allowed some sectors to reopen which was later further relaxed to the \"Recovery MCO\" (RMCO) nationwide. Localized CMCOs restrictions were introduced in the states of Sabah and Selangor were later introduced in response to outbreaks in those states. The MCO was reinstated nationwide in January 2021.\n\n\n=== Myanmar ===\n\nIn September 2020, Myanmar introduced a strict stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire for the entirety of the country's largest city Yangon amid a major local outbreak. All non-essential businesses were ordered to close. The city's 4 million residents were given less than 24 hours notice before the lockdown came into effect.Myanmar's State Administration Council announced a nationwide lockdown in July 2021 in response to an increase in cases and deaths.\n\n\n=== Namibia ===\n\nBeginning 27 March, a 21-day lockdown of the regions of Erongo and Khomas was announced. On 14 April the lockdown was extended to 4 May. It now officially applied to all regions, although the stay-at-home order was already enforced countrywide. Only essential businesses remained open. Schools were closed, parliamentary sessions suspended, and generally all gatherings of more than 10 people were prohibited. Formal and informal bars were closed and the sale of alcohol prohibited. This \"stage 1\" of the lockdown was in force until 4 May 2020. From then on, regulations are to be gradually eased.\n\n\n=== Nepal ===\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\nA lockdown in the Netherlands began on 19 December 2021 which is expected to last (at least) until 14 January 2022.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n\nOn 23 March 2020, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern raised New Zealand's COVID-19 alert level to three and announced the closure of all schools beginning on that day, and two days later moved to four at 11:59 p.m. on 25 March 2020 \u2013 a nationwide lockdown. While all sporting matches and events as well as non-essential services such as pools, bars, cafes, restaurants, playgrounds closed, essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations, and health services remained open.The alert level was moved back down to Level 3 at 11:59 pm on 27 April, and moved to Level 2 at 11:59 pm on 13 May, lifting the rest of the lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing. On 8 June, Prime Minister Ardern announced that New Zealand would be entering into Alert Level 1 at midnight on 9 June, lifting restrictions on daily life, business activities, mass gatherings and public transportation. However, the country's borders would remain closed to most international travel.Following a new outbreak consisting of four cases of community transmission in Auckland on 11 August, the Government placed the Auckland Region on a Level 3 lockdown from 12:00 am on 12 August while the rest of the country move to Level 2 at the same time. On 30 August, Prime Minister Ardern announced that Auckland would enter into \"Alert Level 2.5\" from 11:59pm on that night while the rest of the country would remain on Level 2. Under Level 2.5, all social gatherings including birthday parties will be limited to ten people; masks will be mandatory for all Aucklanders using public transportation; and aged care facilities will be operating under strict conditions. The only public gatherings allowed in Auckland are funerals and tangihanga, which will be limited to 50 people.A new community case of COVID-19 in New Zealand was reported on 17 August 2021, after many months without one. In response, the Government took the country to a full nationwide Alert Level 4 lockdown beginning the following day. One week later, that lockdown remained in place as community case numbers for this community outbreak of the Delta variant reached 148.\n\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n\nNigeria announced a lockdown in early 2020 that lasted for two weeks, beginning on 30 March and ending on 12 April. The lockdown in Nigeria was a very short one.\n\n\n=== Pakistan ===\n\nIn March 2020, Pakistan announced a lockdown that lasted until May. The lockdown in the country was also one of the shortest.\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\n\n\n=== Russia ===\n\n\n=== Singapore ===\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\n\n=== Thailand ===\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nStay-at-home orders in the United States have come from several states and a large number of local jurisdictions, sometimes leading to conflicts between different levels of government and a patchwork of inconsistent dates and rules.On 15 March 2020, Puerto Rico governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced signed an executive order to order all citizens to stay home starting at 9 p.m. with exceptions in limited circumstances between 5 a.m. and 9 pm. Governmental operations and non-essential businesses were to be closed until 30 March.The first order within the states was simultaneously imposed by health authorities in heart of the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties and the cities of San Francisco and Berkeley) effective 17 March 2020, affecting nearly 6.7 million people. Other cities and counties across the state followed suit over the next two days, until Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, issued a state-wide order effective 19 March 2020.On 20 March 2020, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state-wide stay-at-home order with a mandate that 100% of non-essential workforce to be conducted as working from home effective 22 March. Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker followed that lead on the same day with a state-wide order which would go into effect on 21 March at 5 pm. Ned Lamont, the governor of Connecticut, signed an executive order called \"Stay Safe, Stay At Home\" to take effect state-wide on 23 March at 8 p.m.\nOn 20 March 2020, Navajo Nation announced that it had broadened the stay-at-home order to cover the entire reservation, the largest in the country.\n\nOn 21 March 2020, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy announced a state-wide stay-at-home order effective at 9 p.m. on the same day.On 22 March 2020, Ohio governor Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton issued a state-wide stay-at-home order effective 23 March. In the afternoon, the Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards announced a state-wide stay-at-home order in a press conference. Delaware governor John Carney followed suit with a stay-at-home order for his state.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, several state governors announced their state-wide stay-at-home order:\n\nMassachusetts governor Charlie Baker ordered non-essential businesses to close in-person operations effective 24 March until 7 April and directed the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to issue a stay-at-home advisory.\nMichigan governor Gretchen Whitmer announced her state-wide executive order to stay-at-home at 11:00 am for all non-essential businesses effective 24 March until 28 May.\nIndiana governor Eric Holcomb announced state-wide stay-at-home order effective 25 March until 7 April.\nWest Virginia governor Jim Justice ordered non-essential businesses to be closed immediately, and stay-at-home order effective at 8 pm.\nAfter growing calls from local officials on Sunday, Oregon governor Kate Brown issued a stay-at-home order on Monday effective immediately with class C misdemeanor charges for violators.\nNew Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a state-wide stay-at-home order that requires 100% of non-essential business workforce to work from home effective 24 March until 10 April.\nWashington governor Jay Inslee signed a state-wide stay-at-home proclamation and ordered to close non-essential businesses effective 25 March for two weeks.\nHawaii governor David Ige issued a state-wide stay-at-home order effective 25 March which was similar to the orders that were previously issued for Maui and Honolulu counties.On 23 March 2020, Yakama Nation announced its \"Stay Home, Stay Healthy\" order.On 24 March 2020, Wisconsin governor Tony Evers issued a state-wide stay-at-home order to close all non-essential businesses and ordered no gatherings of any size effective 25 March until 24 April. Vermont governor Phil Scott signed a stay-at-home order and directed closure of in-person operations of non-essential businesses effective 25 March until 15 April.On 25 March, Idaho governor Brad Little and Minnesota governor Tim Walz issued stay-at-home orders for their respective states. Colorado Governor Jared Polis issued a stay at home order effective on Thursday the 26th at 6 a.m. through 11 April 2020.On 1 April, Florida governor Ron DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order effective Friday, 3 April 2020 until the end of the month. On 2 April, Georgia governor Brian Kemp issued a stay-at-home order effective Friday, 3 April 2020, until Monday, 13 April 2020. It overrules any local stay-at-home restrictions previously in place, and instructs residents to stay at home unless they're conducting \"essential services,\" meaning either traveling to and from jobs or other exceptions, including buying groceries; purchasing medical equipment; going out to exercise; and visiting medical facilities. The same day, Dr. Anthony Fauci publicly questioned why all states were not under stay-at-home orders.In late May 2020, citywide curfews were enacted in San Francisco and several surrounding cities; San Jose; Minneapolis; Atlanta; Chicago; Cleveland; Columbus; Denver; Jacksonville, FL; Los Angeles; Memphis, TN; Omaha, Nebraska; Lincoln, Nebraska; Pittsburgh, Philadelphia; Portland; Salt Lake City; San Antonio; Buffalo, New York; Rochester, NY; Syracuse; New York City; Milwaukee; Seattle; Cincinnati; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fayetteville; Raleigh, North Carolina; Charleston, SC; Sacramento, CA; Columbia, SC; and Asheville, NC due to protests regarding the murder of George Floyd. Countywide curfews were enacted for Los Angeles County, California and Alameda County, California as well. Arizona enacted a state-wide curfew. These curfews are imposed as complemented to stay-at-home order that imposed by state or local authorities.\nOn 2 November 2020, Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker issued a night-time stay-at-home advisory and business curfew effective 6 November 2020.\n\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\n\n==== Nationwide isolation ====\n\n\n==== Da Nang ====\n\n\n==== Ho Chi Minh city and southern provinces ====\n\n\n== Countries and territories without lockdowns ==\n\nMost countries and territories affected with COVID-19 introduced and enforced some form of lockdown. However, only a few exceptions included Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which rapidly and consistently implemented highly organized mass testing, contact tracing, public messaging and selective quarantining to identify and isolate outbreaks. South Korea's K-Quarantine system was praised in international media for its effectiveness. Authorities in Tokyo, the capital of Japan, advised businesses to close and the population to stay at home, but did not have legal authority to enforce a lockdown or penalise non-compliance. Compliance with advice was nevertheless high.In the European Union, the only nation not following this strategy is Sweden. Led by its state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell measures in Sweden included the closing of universities and high schools and asking older and at-risk residents to avoid social contact, while keeping restaurants, primary schools and kindergartens open and not mandating face masks. However, in early 2021, new laws permitting lockdown were enacted and Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven warned that a lockdown was being considered. As of November 2021, a national lockdown has not been announced. However certain regions of Sweden have declared their own lockdowns to help slow the rate of infection. The region of Uppsala reported 908 cases per 100,000 people over a two-week period compared to a national average of 772 in early April 2021. This caused the Health Chief of the region, Mikael K\u00f6hler, to ask individuals within the region to \"act as if they were in a personal lockdown.\"Some of the countries that did not enact lockdowns during 2020, did so later in the pandemic. In Malawi, a proposed lockdown by the government was delayed by the High Court throughout 2020, until a state of emergency was declared and the country entered a lockdown in January 2021 in response to a worsening outbreak. Although Cambodia restricted movement within the country during a period in 2020, it introduced its first major restrictions, including a curfew and later a stay-at-home order in the capital Phnom Penh, during its largest outbreak to date in early 2021. East Timor also enacted its first lockdown of its capital Dili in March 2021 and Turkey entered its first nationwide lockdown in April 2021.Two states in Brazil and several others in the United States did not introduce any lockdown-type measures (commonly known as \"stay-at-home orders\").\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Prominent national and intergovernmental health agencies and their leaders have recommended the use of masks to reduce transmission, including the WHO, American, European and Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and American immunologist and NIAID director Anthony Fauci.Masks have been extensively adopted across the world. In March 2021, it was estimated that 129 billion face masks were being used per month.\n\n\n== Types of masks ==\nIn the COVID-19 pandemic, governments recommend the use of face masks with a main purpose for the general population: to avoid the contagion from infected people to others. Masks with exhalation valves are not recommended, because they expel the breath of the wearer outwards, and an infected wearer would transmit the viruses through the valve. A second purpose of the face masks is to protect each wearer from environments that can be infected, which can be achieved by many models of masks.Between the different types of face masks that have been recommended throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher or lower effectivity, it is possible to include:\ncloth face masks\nsurgical masks (medical masks)\ncertified face-covering masks, considered respirators, with certifications such as N95 and N99, and FFP\nfiltering respirators with certifications such as N95 and N99, and FFP\nother respirators, including elastomeric respirators, some of which may also be considered filtering masksThere are some other types of personal protective equipment (PPE), as face shields and medical goggles, that are sometimes used in conjunction with face masks but are not recommended as a replacement. Other kinds of PPE include gloves, aprons, gowns, shoe covers and hair covers.There have been shortages of masks, which has led to the use of uncertified masks, with a worse performance.\n\n\n=== Cloth masks ===\n\nA cloth face mask is worn over the mouth and nose and made of common textiles such as cotton. Masks vary widely in effectiveness, depending on factors such as material, fit and seal, and number of layers. They are usually less effective at filtering than surgical masks and offer much less protection that filtering respirators. Unlike disposable masks, there are no required standards for cloth masks.One 2020 study found that a cloth mask was better than nothing, but not as good as a soft electret-filter surgical mask for protecting healthcare workers while simulating treatment of an artificially infected patient. Research on commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks found that cloth masks can provide significant protection against the transmission of particles in the aerosol size range, with enhanced performance across the nanoscale and microscale when masks utilize both mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration, but that leakage due to improper fit can degrade performance. A review of available research published in January 2021 concludes that cloth masks are not considered adequate to protect healthcare practitioners in a clinical setting.A 2013 study had volunteers wear masks they made themselves from cotton T-shirts, following the pattern of a standard tie behind the head surgical mask, and found the number of microscopic particles that leaked to the inside of the homemade masks was twice that of commercial masks. Wearing homemade masks also leaked a median average of three times as many microorganisms as commercial masks. But another 2020 study found that masks made of at least two layers of T-shirt fabric could be as protective against virus droplets as medical masks, and as breathable.\n\nA 2020 peer-reviewed summary of published literature on the filtration properties of cloth and cloth masks recommends two to four layers of plain-weave cotton or flannel, of at least 100 threads per inch. There is a trade-off in that increasing the number of layers increases the filtration of the material but decreases breathability.\nAs of May 2020, there was no research on decontaminating and reusing cloth masks. The CDC recommends removing a mask by handling only the ear loops or ties, placing it directly in a washing machine, and immediately washing hands in soap and water for at least twenty seconds. Cold water is considered as effective as warm water for decontamination. The CDC also recommends washing hands before putting on the mask, and again immediately after touching it.There is no information on reusing an interlayer filter. Disposing of filters after a single use may be desirable. A narrative review of the literature on filtration properties of cloth and other household materials did not find support for the idea of using a filter. A layer of cloth, if tolerated, was suggested instead, or a PM2.5 filter, as a third layer.A United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Study published April 5 2021, showed extremely varied performance across cotton masks. The lack of clearly regulated standards at this stage meaning manufacturers are left to their own devices when designing masks. A clear factor in efficiency being fit, with a 2-layer nylon mask with nose bridge (and ear loops) At 79% Efficiency for the mask tested, clearly out performing a 3-layer cotton mask with only ear loops at only 26.5% efficiency for the mask tested. With no manufacturer or model noted it is highly recommended that Surgical (with modified fit) or N95 (and related variants) be used in place of Cotton face masks where practicable. . \n\n\n=== Surgical masks ===\n\nA surgical mask is a loose-fitting, disposable mask that creates a physical barrier separating the mouth and nose of the wearer from potential contaminants in the immediate environment. If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria, keeping them from reaching the wearer's mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of others to the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions.Certified medical masks are made of non-woven material, and they are mostly multi-layer. Filters may be made of microfibers with an electrostatic charge; that is, the fibers are electrets. An electret filter increases the chances that smaller particles will veer and hit a fiber, rather than going straight through (electrostatic capture). While there is some development work on making electret filtering materials that can be washed and reused, current commercially produced electret filters are ruined by many forms of disinfection, including washing with soap and water or alcohol, which destroys the electric charge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities issued guidelines on how to save, disinfect and reuse electret-filter masks without damaging the filtration efficiency. Standard disposable surgical masks are not designed to be washed. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental, or medical procedure masks. The material surgical masks are made from is much poorer at filtering very small particles (in range a tenth of a micrometer to a micrometer across) than that of filtering respirators (for example N95, FFP2) and the fit is much poorer. Surgical masks are made of a non-woven fabric created using a melt blowing process. Random control studies of respiratory infections like influenza find little difference in protection between surgical masks and respirators (such as N95 or FFP masks). However, the filtering performance of correctly worn N95/FFP2 type filtering respirators is clearly superior to surgical and to cloth masks and for influenza, work by the UK Health and Safety executive found that live virus penetrated all surgical masks tested but properly fitted respirators reduced the viral dose by a factor of at least a hundred.\n\nSurgical masks made to different standards in different parts of the world have different ranges of particles which they filter. For example, the People's Republic of China regulates two types of such masks: single-use medical masks (Chinese standard YY/T 0969) and surgical masks (YY 0469). The latter ones are required to filter bacteria-sized particles (BFE \u2265 95%) and some virus-sized particles (PFE \u2265 30%), while the former ones are required to only filter bacteria-sized particles.\n\n\n==== Modifications ====\nThe effectiveness of surgical masks in limiting particle transmission is a function of material and fit. Since the start of the pandemic, scientists have evaluated various modifications to ear loop surgical masks aimed at improving mask efficacy by reducing or eliminating gaps between the mask and face. The CDC evaluated and recommends two such modifications to ear loop masks to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Under normal use, the CDC found that a surgical mask worn by a coughing individual blocked 41.3% of simulated cough aerosols (0.1\u20137.0 \u03bcm particle size) from reaching a second individual six feet away. However, by applying a knot and tuck technique, 62.9% of particles were blocked. When the surgical mask was covered with a larger cloth mask, 82% of particles were blocked. When both the source and recipient wore masks, 84% of particles were blocked. The number increased to more than 95% when both parties either wore double masks (surgical mask with larger cloth mask) or used the knot and tuck technique.Another type of modifications was aimed to improve the comfort of the wearers. Early on in the pandemic, healthcare workers were required to continue wearing surgical masks for 12 or more hours a day. This caused the ear loops of the masks to chafe the back of their ears. Ear savers, plastic straps and hooks that go around wearer's heads, were invented to move the ear loops away from the wearer's ears. They could be made on demand by using 3D printing process.\n\n\n=== Filtering respirators ===\n\nAn N95 mask is a particulate-filtering facepiece respirator that meets the N95 air filtration rating of the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, meaning it filters at least 95 percent of airborne particles, while not resistant to oil like the P95. It is the most common particulate-filtering facepiece respirator. It is an example of a mechanical filter respirator, which provides protection against particulates, but not gases or vapors. Like the middle layer of surgical masks, the N95 mask is made of four layers of melt-blown nonwoven polypropylene fabric. The corresponding face mask used in the European Union is the FFP2 respirator.Hard electret-filter masks like N95 and FFP masks must fit the face to provide full protection. Untrained users often get a reasonable fit, but fewer than one in four gets a perfect fit. Fit testing is thus standard. A line of petroleum jelly on the edge of the mask has been shown to reduce edge leakage in lab tests using mannequins that simulate breathing.Some N95 series respirators, especially those intended for industrial use, have an exhalation valve to improve comfort, making exhalation easier and reducing leakage on exhalation and steaming-up of glasses. But those respirators are not reliable for the control of infected people (source control) in respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, because infected users (asymptomatic or not) would transmit the virus to others through the valve.During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were shortages of filtering facepiece respirators, and they had to be used for extended periods, and/or disinfected and reused. At the time, public health authorities issued guidelines on how to save, disinfect and reuse masks, as some disinfection methods damaged their filtration efficiency. Some hospitals stockpiled used masks as a precaution, and some had to sanitize and reuse masks.\n\n\n=== Face shields and eye protection ===\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend the use of face shields as a substitute for masks to help slow the spread of COVID-19. In a study by Lindsley et al. (7 January 2021) funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, part of the CDC, face shields were found to block very few cough aerosols in contrast to face coverings \u2013 such as cloth masks, procedure masks, and N95 respirators \u2013 indicating that face shields are not effective as source control devices for small respiratory aerosols and that face coverings are more effective than face shields as source control devices to reduce the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.In a scoping review, Godoy et al. (5 May 2020) said face shields are used for barrier protection against splash and splatter contamination, but should not be used as primary protection against respiratory disease transmission due to the lack of a peripheral seal rather than as an adjunct to other facial protection. They remarked that face shields have been used like this alongside medical-grade masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. They cited a cough simulation study by Lindsley et al. (2014) in which face shields were shown to reduce the risk of inhalation exposure up to 95% immediately following aerosol production, but the protection was decreased with smaller aerosol particles and persistent airborne particles around the sides.A systematic review of observational studies on the transmission of coronaviruses, funded by the World Health Organization found that eye protection including face shields was associated with less infection (adjusted odds ratio 0.22; 95% confidence interval 0\u00b712 to 0\u00b739), but the evidence was rated as low certainty.\n\n\n=== Elastomeric respirators ===\n\nElastomeric respirators are reusable personal protective equipment comprising a tight-fitting half-facepiece or full-facepiece respirator with exchangeable filters such as cartridge filters. They provide an alternative respiratory protection option to filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks. Some healthcare workers have used them during times of short supply caused by the pandemic, as they can be reused over an extended period in healthcare settings. However, most elastomeric respirators have an unfiltered exhalation vent which would allow the virus to spread from the wearer.For the COVID-19 response when supplies are short, the US CDC says contingency and crisis strategies should be followed: Each elastomeric respirator is issued for the exclusive use of an individual healthcare provider but must be cleaned and disinfected as often as necessary to remain unspoiled and sanitary. If there is no other option than to share a respirator between healthcare providers, the respirator must be cleaned and disinfected before it is worn by a different individual. Filters (except for unprotected disc types) may be used for an extended period, but the filter housing of cartridge types must be disinfected after each patient interaction.\n\n\n=== Powered air-purifying respirators ===\n\nA powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) is a personal protective equipment in which a device with a filter and fan creates a highly filtered airflow towards the headpiece and a positive outflow of air from the headpiece.There is an increased risk for healthcare workers to become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 when they conduct aerosol-generating procedures on COVID-19 patients, which is why it is argued that such situations may require enhanced personal protective equipment (i.e., higher than N95) such as PAPRs for healthcare workers.In a systematic review, Licina, Silvers, and Stuart (8 August 2020) said field studies indicate that there was equivalent rates of infection between healthcare workers, who performed airway procedures on critical COVID-19 patients, utilizing PAPRs or other appropriate respiratory equipment (such as N95 or FFP2), but remarked that there is a need to further collect field data about optimal respiratory protection during highly virulent pandemics.\n\n\n=== Face masks with exhalation valves ===\n\nSome masks include an exhalation valve to expel the breath outwards, but that current of air is not filtered. Certification (as N95 or FFP2) is about the mask itself and does not warrant any safety about the air that is exhaled. Putting tape over the exhalation valve can make a mask or respirator as effective as one without a valve.Scientists have visualized droplet dispersal for masks with exhalation valves and face shields, and concluded that they can be ineffective against COVID-19 spread (e.g., after a cough) and recommended alternatives.\n\n\n== Recommendations ==\nThe use of face masks or coverings by the general public has been recommended by health officials to minimize the risk of transmissions, with authorities either requiring their use in certain settings, such as on public transport and in shops, or universally in public.\nHealth officials had advised that medical-grade face masks, such as respirators, should be prioritized for use by healthcare workers in view of critical shortages, so they used to generally first and foremost recommend cloth masks for the general public. However, recommendations have changed as the body of scientific knowledge evolved.Scientists now recommend having a triple-layered surgical mask and a respirator.According to #Masks4All, about 95% of the world population lives in countries where the government and leading disease experts recommend or require the use of masks in public places to limit the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\n=== World Health Organization ===\n\nEarly in 2020, the WHO had only recommended medical masks for people with suspected infection and respiratory symptoms, their caregivers and those sharing living space, and healthcare workers. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19, but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. First, experts and researchers pointed out the asymptomatic transmission of the virus. Second, according to Marteau et al. (27 July 2020), available evidence does not support the notion that masking adversely affects hand hygiene: Dame Theresa Marteau, one of the researchers, remarked that \"The concept of risk compensation, rather than risk compensation itself, seems the greater threat to public health through delaying potentially effective interventions that can help prevent the spread of disease.\"The WHO revised its mask guidance in June 2020, with its officials acknowledging that studies indicated asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread. The updated advice recommended that the general public should wear non-medical fabric masks where there is known or suspected widespread transmission and where physical distancing is not possible, and that vulnerable people (60 and over, or with underlying health risks) and people with any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 as well as caregivers and healthcare workers should wear surgical or procedure masks. They stated that the purpose of mask usage is to prevent the wearer transmitting the virus to others (source control) and to offer protection to healthy wearers against infection (prevention).The WHO advises that non-medical fabric masks should comprise a minimum of three layers, suggesting an inner layer made of absorbent material (such as cotton), a middle layer made of non-woven material (such as polypropylene) which may enhance filtration or retain droplets, and an outer layer made of non-absorbent material (such as polyester or its blends) which may limit external contamination from penetration.On 21 August 2020, the WHO and UNICEF released an annex guidance for children. For children five and younger, they advise that masks should not be required in consideration to a child's developmental milestones, compliance challenges, and autonomy required to use a mask properly, but recognized that the evidence supporting their cut-off age is limited and countries may hold a different and lower age of cut-off. For children 6\u201311, they advise that mask usage should be decided in consideration of several factors including the intensity of local viral transmission, (the latest evidence about) the risk of infection for the age group, the social and cultural environment (which influences social interactions in communities and populations), the capacity to comply with appropriate mask usage, the availability of appropriate adult supervision, and the potential impact on learning and psychosocial development, as well as additional factors involving specific settings or circumstances (such as disabilities, underlying diseases, elderly people, sport activities, and schools). For children 12 and older, they advise that masks should be worn under the same conditions for adults in accordance to WHO guidance or national guidelines.Regarding the use of non-medical fabric masks in the general population, the WHO has stated that high-quality evidence for its widespread use is limited, but advises governments to encourage its use as physical distancing may not be possible in some settings, there is some evidence for asymptomatic transmission, and masks could be helpful to provide a barrier to limit the spread of potentially infectious droplets.\n\n\n=== United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ===\n\nEarly in 2020, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it did not recommend the use of face masks for the general public. However, on 3 April 2020, the CDC changed its advice to recommend that people wear cloth face coverings \"in public settings when around people outside their household, especially when social distancing measures are difficult to maintain\". In response to a media inquiry by National Public Radio, the CDC said that this change in guidelines was due to the increasing and widespread transmission of the virus, citing studies published in February and March showing pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. In a subsequent interview and JAMA editorial, the CDC director Robert R. Redfield explained that the CDC's early guidance had been premised on an initial absence of evidence of disease transmission from pre- and asymptomatic individuals.\n\nSince 28 June, the \"CDC recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings and when around people who don't live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Cloth face coverings may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others. Cloth face coverings are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.\" The CDC provides the caveat that cloth face coverings should not be worn by children under the age of two, people who have trouble breathing, or people who are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. In August 2020, the CDC added that exhalation valves or vents in masks do not help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others.In a November 2020 scientific brief, the CDC reiterated their recommendation for the community use of masks and specifically non-valved multi-layer cloth masks to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. They say the community's use of masks serves two primary purposes: to reduce the emission of virus-laden droplets from exhalation into the environment (source control), which is especially relevant for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected wearers who feel well and may be unaware of their infectiousness to others, and to reduce inhalation of these droplets through filtration for the wearer (personal protection). For filtration, the CDC says some fabrics (such as silk) may hydrophobically repel moist droplets, whereas other fabrics (such as polyester or polypropylene) may electrostatically capture droplets. They concluded that the benefit of masking for SARS-CoV-2 control is derived from the combination of source control and personal protection, which is likely complementary and possibly synergistic, so that individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use.The CDC said healthcare personnel should wear a NIOSH-approved N95 (or equivalent or higher-level) respirator or a face mask (if a respirator is not available) with a face shield or goggles as part of their personal protective equipment, while patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should wear a face mask or cloth face covering during transport. As crisis strategy for known shortages of N95 respirators in healthcare settings, among other sequential measures, the CDC suggests use of respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life, use of respirators approved under standards used in other countries that are similar to NIOSH-approved respirators, limited re-use of respirators, use of additional respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life that have not been evaluated by NIOSH, and prioritizing the use of respirators and face masks by activity type.In late July 2021, the CDC changed guidelines to recommend people, including those who are vaccinated, to continue masking in public indoor settings in areas with substantial and high transmission\u2014as there are indications that the coronavirus such as the Delta variant may infect even vaccinated people in rare occasions\u2014to help prevent transmission to other people. Previously, the CDC updated public guidance from May 2021 stated that those who are fully vaccinated can \"resume activities without wearing masks or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.\" However, critics posited that it was predicated on a key social factor, namely whether people can be trusted to wear a mask if they are not fully vaccinated.On February 25, 2022, the CDC changed their guidelines to suggest that 70% of Americans need no longer wear masks, and no longer need to social distance or avoid crowded spaces.  Under the new guidance, Americans in counties designated as medium-to-low-risk can go indoors without masks. In accordance with these new CDC guidelines, a number of US states ended their mask mandates for indoor spaces. However, federal officials emphasized that regardless of local conditions, individuals with COVID-19 or COVID-19 symptoms, as well as individuals who consider themselves to be high-risk, should continue to wear facial coverings. In addition to this, the CDC also dropped its recommendation for universal school mask mandates.  These new recommendations assessed COVID-19 hospitalizations as well as the proportion of beds occupied by COVID-19 patients in certain areas. \n\n\n==== Criticism of guidance ====\nLarry Gostin, a professor of public health law, said initial CDC and WHO guidance had given the public the wrong impression that masks do not work, even though scientific evidence to the contrary was already available. The confusing changing advice from discouraging to recommending public masking has led to decreasing public trust in the CDC. In June 2020 Anthony Fauci, a leading infectious disease expert for the United States government, stated that the delay in recommending general mask use was motivated by a desire to conserve dwindling supplies for medical professionals.\n\n\n=== China and Asia ===\n\nIn March 2020, when asked about the mistakes that other countries were making in the pandemic, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention director-general George Fu Gao said:\n\n\"The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren't wearing masks. This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role \u2013 you've got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.\"\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nMost countries in Europe have introduced mandatory face mask rules for public places. On 8 April 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published its masking recommendations, saying that the \"use of face masks in the community could be considered, especially when visiting busy, closed spaces\". On 15 February 2021, ECDC updated the recommendation stating \"Although the evidence for the use of medical face masks in the community to prevent COVID-19 is limited, face masks should be considered as a non-pharmaceutical intervention in combination with other measures as part of efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic.\"The Nordic countries and the Netherlands have been a notable exception to supporting the use of face masks, but eventually started to recommend masks. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, wearing a mouth/nose mask was made mandatory on public transportation per 1 June 2020. The main reasoning against masks recommendations given by officials in the Nordic countries was that public masking is deemed an unnecessary precaution when infection levels remain low. In June 2020, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said asymptomatic individuals wearing face masks was not to be recommended due to the low prevalence of COVID-19 in the country, but noted that it should be reconsidered if cases rise. Similarly, on 30 July 2020, the Danish Health Authority director S\u00f8ren Brostr\u00f8m said face covers did not make sense in the current situation with low infection levels, but that they needed to evaluate whether it could make sense in the long term. From 29 October, face masks are mandatory inside in any building in Denmark that has public access \u2013 from supermarkets and kiosks to hospitals and schools. In many Norwegian local municipalities, face masks are mandatory on public transport where a social distance of one metre is impossible to maintain.Sweden in particular stands out as a country where face masks have not been recommended to the general public and the State Epidemiologist of Sweden, Anders Tegnell, has been an opponent to face masks among the general population, although he has said that face masks might be suitable on work places where people are one to two meter from each other's for more than fifteen minutes, something which some Swedish and foreign media have interpreted as a recommendation. This position was slightly reversed when Prime Minister of Sweden, Stefan L\u00f6fven, announced that they were recommending face masks on 18 December 2020. The Public Health Agency of Sweden later clarified on their website that the recommendation would include citizens born before 2004 to wear masks during rush hour on public transportation throughout the country from 7 January 2021 onward. On 20 December 2020, two days after the announcement was made, Prime Minister L\u00f6fven was paparazzied in a shopping mall in central Stockholm without wearing a face mask. By 22 January 2021 the Stockholm Public Transport estimated that about half of all passengers on trains and busses wore face masks during rush hour. Among those who chose not to follow the recommendation were Johan Carlson, the Director-General of the Public Health Agency, and Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist.\n\n\n== Rationale for wearing masks ==\n\nMasks are used to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory droplets and aerosols, which are thought to be the major pathways of infection, exhaled from infected individuals during breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing.The National Health Commission of China cited the following reasons for the wearing of masks by the public, including healthy individuals:\n\nAsymptomatic transmission. Many people can be infected without symptoms or only with mild symptoms.\nDifficulty or impossibility of appropriate social distancing in many public places at all times.\nCost-benefit mismatch. If only infected individuals wear masks, they would possibly have a negative incentive to do so. An infected individual might get nothing positive, but only bear the costs such as inconvenience, purchasing expenses, and even prejudice.\nThere is no shortage of masks in China. The country has the production capacity to meet the demand on masks.In a comment to The Lancet, Kar Keung Cheng, Tai Hing Lam, and Chi Chiu Leung argued that a public health rationale for mass masking is source control to protect others from respiratory droplets and underscored the importance of this approach due to asymptomatic transmission. Wang Linfa, an infectious disease expert who heads a joint Duke University and National University of Singapore research team, said masking is about \"preventing the spread of disease rather than preventing getting the disease\", remarking that the point is to cover the faces of people who are infected but do not know it, so it is imperative for everyone to wear one in public. The US CDC also highlighted the use of masks for source control, pointing out that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are estimated to account for over 50% of the transmissions.Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist from the University of Hong Kong, states a high amount of virus strands in saliva of infected people and transmission by asymptomatic carriers as the reasons why even seemingly healthy individuals should wear a mask. Kelvin Kai-Wang To et al. (February 2020) detected live SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of infected patients, which indicated that the virus may be transmitted directly or indirectly through saliva with or without respiratory symptoms, and stated that the findings reinforced the use of surgical masks as a control measure.Monica Gandhi, a medical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, says viral shedding at high quantities from the upper respiratory tract, characterized by unusually high levels of viral particles, means universal mask wearing is one of the best ways to limit the asymptomatic spread of the virus. Yixuan Hou et al. (July 2020) found that the nasal cavity is seemingly the dominant initial site for SARS-CoV-2 infection with subsequent aspiration-mediated virus seeding into the lungs; the authors note that these findings argue for the widespread use of masks to prevent exposure to the nasal passages.In a perspective, Monica Gandhi, Chris Beyrer, and Eric Goosby posit that masking reduces the dose of the virus for the wearer and thus helps lower the severity of infection. They highlighted that the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infection increased in settings adopting population-level masking. One example involved a comparison of outbreaks on cruise ships: the Diamond Princess had 18% asymptomatic cases among all the infected people, but this was 81% in the Greg Mortimer where masks were given to passengers and staff members.Trisha Greenhalgh et al. argue for the precautionary principle as a reason to adopt policies encouraging the wearing of face masks in public, given that there's much to gain and little to lose from adopting masks considering the seriousness of the outbreak. Others agreed, based on the evidence-based principle that the likely benefits outweighed the likely harms.Leonardo Setti et al. argue that face masks should be used to complement social distancing of six feet or two meters, because this inter-personal distance is more effective if people are masked as studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted over greater distances. Chi Chiu Leung et al. also argue that face masks complement social distancing, as a high degree of compliance for distancing is necessary to achieve the greatest impact but is not always achievable. For instance, even if social distancing is rigorously practiced, there are necessary person-to-person contacts (such as going to the supermarket and other necessary activities to sustain livelihoods), so masks would help in situations when social distancing is not feasible and maximize the effect of social distancing.According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, \"Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.\" Ka Hung Chan and Kwok-Yung Yuen argue that face masks can reduce fomite transmission (in addition to transmission through droplets or aerosol) of the virus, as masks can prevent people from spreading body fluids by touching their noses or mouths (such as trying to cover up a sneeze or cough).A paper by Miyu Moriyama et al. (September 2020), which links seasonality of respiratory viral diseases to decreased air humidity due to indoor heating, argues that mask wearing helps limiting respiratory virus transmission in winter, because masks keep the nose warm and moist.Social media claims that masks could reduce the oxygen levels in older people were refuted by a small study of SpO2 levels, the results of which were published by JAMA.\n\n\n== Efficacy ==\nPopulation-wide masking has proven significant in reducing the transmission of COVID-19. Masks, however, are not of equal efficacy. While N95 masks outperform surgical masks in filtration, healthcare worker population studies have not shown a significant difference between the two, as of June 2021. N95 and surgical masks, both designed for single-use, can be decontaminated at a loss to mask integrity and filtration efficacy. Both N95 and surgical outperform cloth masks, which the general public has used based on its greater availability during mask supply shortages. Cloth and fabric masks have protected wearers from COVID-19, with some variability, such as fabric type, layer count, and mask fit. Cloth masks are insufficient for healthcare workers and not recommended, according to two randomly controlled trials.Small-scale observational studies have shown evidence that masks reduce the community spread of COVID-19. More reliable, randomized controlled population trials are uncommon due to ethical and logistical issues. Clinical evidence of mask efficacy in COVID-19 transmission is limited, as of May 2021, and has been the subject of scientific debate. Clinical studies had not evaluated the efficacy of cloth masks in COVID-19 transmission by the end of the year. Evaluation of cloth mask efficacy is further complicated by the wide variation in fabric and fit, among other factors. Concerning the precedent of mask efficacy in limiting transmission of respiratory viral illnesses other than COVID, a clinical trial meta-analysis in May 2021 showed no significant evidence of efficacy, though the authors noted the evidence to be of poor quality and subject to confounding factors like adherence to consistent mask usage.Community studies have shown cloth masks to be effective at limiting the spread of COVID-19. Cloth masks of cotton quilt (120 thread per inch), bonded copy paper, flannel, and chiffon or silk hybrid with cotton are over 90% effective at blocking particles the size of COVID-19, according to an October 2021 review of 42 studies. Multilayered fabrics provided improved breathability and filtration efficacy. Among readily available fabrics, two-layered 100% cotton, two-layered cotton quilt, hybrid masks, and cotton flannel performed best. Filtration effectiveness generally improves with thread count.A Danish randomized controlled trial performed in April and May of 2020 did not find any statistically significant reduction in infection rates among adults wearing surgical masks. The study was conducted among six thousand adults who reported spending three or more hours outside every day. The intervention group was provided with 50 high-quality (98% filtration rate) surgical masks and 93% of the group predominantly wore the masks as instructed. At the time of the study, Denmark had no mask recommendation and the use of masks was less than 5% in the community. As of February 2022, the study is the only RCT measuring the effectiveness of masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nA WHO-funded systematic review published in The Lancet found that the usage of face mask could result in a large risk reduction of infection with epidemic-causative beta coronaviruses, in which N95 or similar respirators accounted for a larger risk reduction than disposable surgical or other similar masks. Masks were found to be protective for both healthcare workers and people in communities exposed to infection; evidence supported masking in both healthcare and non-healthcare settings, with no striking differences detected in the effectiveness of masks between the settings.The CDC highlighted a number of studies in their 10 November 2020 scientific brief detailing the benefits of community masking. In a study of 124 Beijing households with at least one laboratory-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mask use by the index patient and family contacts before the index patient developed symptoms reduced secondary transmission within the households by 79%. A retrospective case-control study from Thailand documented that, among more than 1,000 people interviewed as part of contact tracing investigations, those who reported having always worn a mask during high-risk exposures experienced a greater than 70% reduced risk of acquiring infection compared with people who did not wear masks under these circumstances. A case study from July 2020 detailed that 139 clients exposed to two symptomatic hair stylists with confirmed COVID-19 (both the clients and the stylists wore face coverings) resulted in no symptomatic cases reported among all clients and no positive tests among the 67 people who volunteered to be tested.  A study of an outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an environment notable for congregate living quarters and close working environments, found that use of face coverings on-board was associated with a 70% reduced risk. Investigations involving infected passengers aboard flights longer than ten hours strongly suggest that masking prevented in-flight transmissions, as demonstrated by the absence of infection developing in other passengers and crew in the 14 days following exposure. In addition, the CDC said the benefit of universal masking, including reductions in infections and mortality, has been demonstrated in community-level analyses by a set of studies involving the Massachusetts hospital system, the German city Jena, the American state Arizona, a panel of 15 American states and Washington, D.C., Canada nationally, and the United States nationally.In addition to studying the impact of mask wearing on transmission in a community, direct studies can be done on whether or not a mask filters out virus-carrying particles from the air. In August 2021, a study of the fabric of masks worn in the community found that they filtered out between half and three-quarters of the viral RNA. Respirators made to a standard such as N95 or FFP2 when properly fitted should filter out at 95% of the virus.\nIn December 2021, a study in PNAS found that when two people wear surgical masks, while the infectious is speaking, the risk of infection remains below 30% after one hour, but when both wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, it is 0.4%.In February 2022, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that surgical masks worn at indoor public venues can reduce the chances of testing positive for COVID-19 by 66%, while tightfitting N95 and KN95 masks can reduce the odds of infection by 83%.\n\n\n=== Optimal face mask designs and use ===\nA scientific review of research about the overall efficacy of face masks in terms of product design (such as thermal comfort and flow resistance) and ways of usage found that fluid dynamics and fabrication techniques have a significant impact on performance. According to the review, studies showed that cotton and surgical masks had a microorganism filtration efficiency of 86.4% and 99.9% respectively, while the surgical mask was three times more effective in blocking transmission than the cotton mask and could lead to a decrease of the effective reproduction number to below 1 \u2013 which could halt epidemic spread in a region where 70% of residents use them consistently in public.By January 2021 several lines of research recommended double-masking (wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask, along with using a mask filter, or wearing a nylon covering over a mask) as being efficacious.\n\n\n== Correct handling and wearing of masks ==\n\nAs masking became widespread during the pandemic, it gave rise to the issue that many individuals of the public are not correctly handling and wearing their masks. Suzanne Willard, a clinical professor at Rutgers School of Nursing, remarked that the general public is not used to wearing masks and lay people are asked to use a tool health care professionals are trained to use.A commonly-seen issue is that people are wearing masks pulled down below the nose, which is an incorrect way to wear a mask. Zane Saul, the chief of infectious disease at Bridgeport Hospital, remarked that \"I really have observed people not covering their noses and just covering their mouths. It's just as important to cover your nose.\" Daniel Gottschall, the vice president of medical affairs for the Fairfield region of Hartford HealthCare and St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, explained that \"By wearing a mask you're keeping a lot of those secretions inside of you. If you wear it just over your nose or just over your mouth and you're not diligent (about keeping it in place), you're exposing the secretions that come out of that part of the body to other people.\"\n\nZeynep Tufekci, a professor of information science, remarked that messaging on masking should have been used to provide proper instructions to the public (as was done for hand washing) rather than used to discourage people from masking because of the possibility that they would wear them improperly, as had happened early in the pandemic. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control highlighted that appropriate use of face masks in communities could be improved through education campaigns and is key for its effectiveness as a measure. Health institutions such as the World Health Organization have provided public guidance on the do's and don'ts on masking.\n\n\n== Shortages of face masks ==\n\n\n=== Early epidemic in mainland China ===\nAs the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market in China saw a shortage of face masks due to increased public demand. Face masks were quickly sold out in stores throughout China. Hoarding and price gouging drove up prices, so the market regulator said it would crack down on such acts. In January 2020, price controls were imposed on all face masks on Taobao and Tmall. Other Chinese e-commerce platforms \u2013 JD.com, Suning.com, Pinduoduo \u2013 did likewise; third-party vendors would be subject to price caps, with violators subject to sanctions.By March, China had quadrupled its production capacity to a hundred million masks per day.\n\n\n=== National stocks and shortages ===\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, the U.S.'s Strategic National Stockpile contained just twelve million N95 respirators, far fewer than estimates of the amount required. Millions of N95s and other supplies were purchased from 2005 to 2007 using congressional supplemental funding, but 85 million N95s were distributed to combat the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and Congress did not make the necessary appropriations to replenish stocks. The Stockpile's primary focus has also primarily been on biodefense (defense against a terrorist or weapon of mass destruction attack) and response to natural disaster, with infectious disease a secondary focus. By 1 April 2020, the Stockpile was nearly emptied of protective gear. In January and February 2020, U.S. manufacturers, with the encouragement of the Trump administration, shipped millions of face masks and other personal protective equipment to the PRC, a decision that subsequently prompted criticism given the mask shortage that the U.S. faced during the pandemic.In France, 2009 H1N1-related spending rose to \u20ac382 million, mainly on supplies and vaccines, which was later criticized. It was decided in 2011 to not replenish its stocks and rely more on supply from China and just-in-time logistics. In 2010, its stock included a billion surgical masks and 600 million FFP2 masks; in early 2020, it was 150 million and zero respectively. While stocks were progressively reduced, a 2013 rationale stated the aim to reduce costs of acquisition and storage, now distributing this effort to all private enterprises as an optional best practice to ensure their workers' protection. This was especially relevant to FFP2 masks, more costly to acquire and store. As the COVID-19 pandemic in France took an increasing toll on medical supplies, masks and PPE supplies ran low, causing national outrage. France needs forty million masks per week, according to French president Emmanuel Macron. France instructed its few remaining mask-producing factories to work 24/7 shifts, and to ramp up national production to forty million masks per month. French lawmakers opened an inquiry on the past management of these strategic stocks. The mask shortage has been called a \"scandal d'\u00c9tat\" (State scandal). Thousands of French individuals and companies teamed up during the outbreak to form a decentralized network of Fab labs and ad-hoc retooled production facilities, producing more than a million face shields, masks and other kinds of PPE during the height of the pandemic.In late March and early April 2020, as Western countries were in turn dependent on China for supplies of masks and other equipment, China was seen as making soft-power play to influence world opinion. However, a batch of masks purchased by the Netherlands was reportedly rejected as being sub-standard. The Dutch health ministry issued a recall of 600,000 face masks from a Chinese supplier on 21 March which did not fit properly and whose filters did not work as intended despite them having a quality certificate. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded that the customer should \"double-check the instructions to make sure that you ordered, paid for and distributed the right ones. Do not use non-surgical masks for surgical purposes.\" Eight million of eleven million masks delivered to Canada in May also failed to meet standards.\n\n\n=== Theft ===\nThefts of face masks and other personal protective equipment have been reported at hospitals in the United States and other countries.\nThe Naval Medical Center San Diego began mandatory random bag checks for staff members, after several incidents of theft. Hospitals in Canada reported that theft of PPE had become so commonplace that face masks had to be locked away. According to hospital staff, the policy of locking up PPE often resulted in staff requests for PPE being denied. Thefts of N95 masks were reported from a locked hospital office in South Carolina and off loading docks at the University of Washington.Two thousand surgical masks were stolen from a hospital in Marseille, France during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak, in March. The masks were stolen from an area of the hospital that could only be accessed by surgery patients and staff. A hospital employee in Cooperstown, New York was charged with misdemeanor larceny for a similar incident. Hospital employees in West Java, Indonesia were arrested for stealing hundreds of boxes of face masks and selling them on the black market.One month later an Indiana hospital pharmacy reported a theft to the Drug Enforcement Agency. Along with morphine, with a street value estimated at $3000, the thieves, one of whom was an employee of the hospital and had an access card, had stolen masks and other in-demand goods. In the criminal complaint, filed in Indiana federal court, a DEA task force officer said:\n\"Based on my training and experience, I know these items are highly sought after in the secondary market due to shortages resulting from the Coronavirus pandemic and that these types of items are being sold on the secondary market at an increased price well over fair market value.\"\nA former hospital employee in Georgia was arrested on allegations of stealing masks and gloves from the hospital on five separate occasions after he was fired. Also in April, an employee of the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center was charged with a misdemeanor for stealing disposable gowns and surgical masks from the hospital. PPE, including masks, were reported stolen by a member of the housekeeping staff at a hospital in Arizona and a physician's assistant in Florida.According to a BBC News report from August 2020, hospital staff in Ghana were selling PPE on the black market.Two government workers from the Federal Law Enforcement training Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, were charged in October for conspiracy to steal PPE, obstruction of justice and lying to the FBI.\n\n\n=== Destruction in wars ===\nDuring the Tigray War that started in November 2020, looting of the means of survival led not only to emergency conditions of acute food insecurity but also to concerns about management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 2021, only five out of forty hospitals were \"physically accessible\" and most hospitals outside of the Tigrayan capital Mekelle had been looted or destroyed.\n\n\n=== N95 and FFP masks ===\nN95 and FFP masks were in short supply and high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Production of N95 masks was limited due to constraints on the supply of nonwoven polypropylene fabric (which is used as the primary filter), as well as the cessation of exports from China. China controls fifty percent of global production of masks, and facing its own coronavirus epidemic, dedicated all its production for domestic use, only allowing exports through government-allocated humanitarian assistance.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nIn March 2020, US President Donald Trump applied the Defense Production Act against the American company 3M, which allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to obtain N95 respirators from 3M. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said there were concerns that 3M products were not making their way to the US. 3M replied that it has not changed the prices it charges, and was unable to control the prices its dealers or retailers charge.Jared Moskowitz, the head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, accused 3M of selling N95 masks directly to foreign countries for cash, instead of to the US. Moskowitz said 3M agreed to authorized distributors and brokers to represent they were selling the masks to Florida, but instead his team for the last several weeks \"get to warehouses that are completely empty\". He then said the 3M-authorized US distributors later told him the masks Florida contracted for never showed up because the company instead prioritized orders that came in later, for higher prices, from foreign countries (including Germany, Russia, and France).Forbes reported that \"roughly 280 million masks from warehouses around the US had been purchased by foreign buyers [on 30 March 2020] and were earmarked to leave the country, according to the broker \u2013 and that was in one day,\" causing massive critical shortages of masks in the US.Masks were still in short supply in late September, eight months into the pandemic. The Defense Production Act powers that averted a ventilator shortage were not used as extensively to increase N95 production, despite outcry from healthcare workers. Even though 3M has increased domestic production from 20 million to 95 million masks a month, they say \"the demand is more than we, and the entire industry, can supply for the foreseeable future.\"\nN95 manufacturers and other companies have been reluctant to invest more in domestic mask production because manufacturing in the United States is not profitable for them. There are some American companies who can shift production temporarily to meet the demand for masks but most of them have not received any funding through the DPA. Some have taken the initiative but there were problems with the fit of the masks and obtaining regulatory approvals. 3M and other N95 manufacturers have not entered into any corporate partnerships to share intellectual property or increase N95 production.Trump gave Rear Admiral John Polowczyk the responsibility for the logistics of PPE. Polowczyk said he believed \"hospital systems are making management decisions that might lead to an appearance that we still don't have masks, which is the farthest from the truth.\"By February 2021, suppliers had increased production but not enough to meet demand. Companies cited concerns about post-pandemic demand as a reason for not entering the market. Hospitals increased supplies, but even at well-funded hospitals, healthcare workers could be expected to wear their masks for up to a month. Counterfeits continued to pose problems for purchasers. Numerous calls by public health experts had been made to provide high-filtration masks such as N95s or their equivalents to the general public in high-risk settings.On 19 January 2022, the Biden Administration is reported to begin freely providing 400 million N95 masks in the United States.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn early April 2020, the Berlin politician Andreas Geisel alleged that a shipment of 200,000 N95 masks it had ordered from American producer 3M's China facility were intercepted in Bangkok, Thailand and diverted to the United States. 3M said they had no knowledge of the shipment, stating \"We know nothing of an order from the Berlin police for 3M masks that come from China.\" The US government denied any confiscation and said they use appropriate channels for all their purchases. Berlin police later confirmed that the shipment was not seized by US authorities.This revelation outraged the Berlin opposition, whose CDU parliamentary group leader Burkard Dregger accused Geisel of \"deliberately misleading Berliners\" in order \"to cover up its own inability to obtain protective equipment\". FDP interior expert Marcel Luthe also criticized Geisel. Politico Europe reported that \"the Berliners are taking a page straight out of the Trump playbook and not letting facts get in the way of a good story.\" The Guardian also reported that \"There is no solid proof Trump [nor any other American official] approved the [German] heist.\"German citizens decided to contribute to solving the supply crisis by making their own masks and other types of PPE like face shields that gave masks additional protection; the largest group of makers measured 6,800 individuals, collectively producing more than 100,000 pieces of protective equipment.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nAs more and more countries restricted the export of N95 masks, Novo Textiles in British Columbia announced plans to start producing N95 masks in Canada. AMD Medicom in Quebec had long been the main Canadian company producing N95s, but China, France, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United States all banned exports of medical equipment, barring Medicom's factories there from exporting the masks to Canada. The Government of Canada subsequently awarded Medicom a 10-year contract to build a factory to produce masks in Montreal.\n\n\n== The mask industry ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\n\n==== China ====\nAs of 2019, mainland China manufactured half the world output of masks.\nAs COVID-19 spread, enterprises in several countries quickly started or increased the production of face masks.\nCottage industries and volunteer groups also emerged, manufacturing cloth masks for localized use. They used various patterns, including some with a bend-to-fit nose piece insert. Individual hospitals developed and requested a library of specific patterns.In the first five months of 2020, 70,802 new companies registered in China to make or trade face masks, a 1,256% increase compared to 2019, and 7,296 new companies registered to make or trade melt blown fabrics, a key component of face masks, a 2,277% rise from 2019.In April, however, the Chinese government stepped in with tighter regulations. 867 producers of the meltblown fabric were shut down in Yangzhong city alone. Many speculative manufacturers have been forced to quit due to changing export rules and tighter licensing requirements in China and weaker demand for lower quality products globally.\n\n\n==== Open Source and Do It Yourself Masks ====\nOpen Source Medical Supplies coordinated and shared open-source mask designs.\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nSome clinical stockpiles have proved inadequate in scale, and the non-medical market demand expanded dramatically as the general public determined that masks were essential, or they began obeying public health mandates, or both.Between April and June 2020, sellers on Etsy sold 29 million cloth face masks worth an estimated $364 million. Approximately four million people (about seven percent of buyers) visited the website just to buy masks.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Attitudes ===\nIn East Asian societies, a primary reason for mask-wearing is to protect others from oneself. The broad assumption behind the act is that anyone, including seemingly healthy people, can be a carrier of the coronavirus. The usage of masks is seen as a collective responsibility to reduce the transmission of the virus. A face mask is thus seen as a symbol of solidarity in Eastern countries. Elsewhere, the need for mask-wearing is still often seen from an individual perspective where masks only serve to protect oneself. In April 2020, a study comparing masking-related perceptions between China and three German speaking countries (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland) also showed that Chinese had stronger pro-masking perceptions than the European participants. However, over the course of the pandemic, people began promoting a new meaning of masking as an act of solidarity to each other. Masking is gradually shifting to become a new social norm. Research on facial masks has shown that wearing face masks increase one's facial attractiveness.\n\nExisting cultural norms and social pressure may impede mask-wearing in public, which explains why masking has been avoided in the West. According to Joseph Tsang, a Hong Kong doctor and infectious disease expert, the promotion of universal masking may resolve perceptions against mask-wearing, because mask-wearing is intimidating if few people wear masks due to cultural barriers, but if all people wear masks it shows a message that people are in this together. A study surveying people in Spain showed that an individual's likelihood of voluntarily wearing a mask is positively correlated with the proportion of uptake in the surrounding area.Helene-Mari van der Westhuizen et al. point out that successful implementation of public masking policies, especially in communities that have no cultural traditions for such interventions, requires a reframing of social meanings and moral worth, and that public messages help to conceptualize who typically wear masks and what the moral valence of masking is. They note that the earliest members who wear face coverings may be seen as deviant when the community starts to adopt masking, but that changing narratives will generate new meanings that construe those who do not mask as deviant. Their argument is that public health messaging about face coverings should shift from masks as a medical intervention to masks as a social practice based on values such as social responsibility and solidarity, as a successful uptake requires face coverings to be grounded in the social and cultural realities of affected communities. Clemens Eisenmann and Christian Meyer argue that the question, how the meaning of wearing face masks develops in society, depends on their practical and public uses within everyday social interactions. They explain that masking has destabilized interactional infrastructures embedded in routines, revealing both taken-for-granted infrastructures of everyday life \u2013 including social inequalities (such as those of people reliant on lip reading) and moral evaluations in transcultural situations (such as those involving implicit racism in which the health instructions of essential workers belonging to certain groups are disregarded) \u2013 and new challenges on the interactional level.In the Western world, the public usage of masks still often carries a large stigma, as it is seen as a sign of sickness. This stigmatization is a large obstacle to overcome, because people may feel too ashamed to wear a mask in public and therefore opt to not wear one. There is also a divide within the Western world, as seen in the Czech Republic and Slovakia where mass mobilization has occurred to reinforce the solidarity in mask-wearing since March 2020.Mask-wearing has been called a prosocial behavior in which one protects others within their community. On social media, there has been an effort with the #masks4all campaign to encourage people to use masks. Nevertheless, there have been many occurrences of violence and hostility by people who became aggressive after they were requested to wear a mask or saw people wearing masks in customer-based establishments. Multiple people have been killed in attacks by people who refused to mask. It has led to concerns about worker safety, so employees have been discouraged to actively enforce masking policies due to the potential of hostile situations, while enforcement by official authorities is severely lacking.Masking has been subjected to racial politics in Western countries. For instance, it has been heavily racialized as an Asian phenomenon. This has been reinforced in a lot of media discourses, where stories about the pandemic are often accompanied by unrelated imagery of Asian people in masks. The focus on race has brought hostility towards Asians who are confronted with the choice to mask as precaution while they face discrimination for it. Huang Yinxiang, a sociologist from the University of Manchester, described maskaphobia (negative prejudice, fear or bitter hatred against people wearing face masks) as making Asians in Western countries into targets for racists who want to legitimize xenophobia during the COVID-19 outbreak. Likewise, people from certain groups such as Black Americans may not feel comfortable wearing masks, especially those that are not clearly medical but homemade masks, due to concerns of racial profiling.\n\nThere have also been concerns that wearing masks may also further isolate disadvantaged communities. Concerns had been expressed that masks would make communication difficult for people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. This led to calls for wider distributions of transparent masks, which allow for lip reading. Similar concerns over difficulty in communicating have been expressed by those who may depend on dogs for therapeutic or social reasons, as the animals depend on body language such as facial expressions. Conversely, people who are exempt from wearing masks on medical grounds or due to a disability, fear they will be subjected to abuse for not wearing a mask, even if they are legally exempt from doing so. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the charity Disability Rights UK received numerous reports about people being confronted on trains and buses. Health organizations such as the American Lung Association commented that, even though there may be people who will seek an exemption, the individual's concerns needs to be weighed against the societal needs to limit the spread of the virus. However, anti-maskers have called upon bogus claims about legal or medical exemptions in their refusal to mask. They have, for instance, claimed that the Americans with Disabilities Act (designed to prohibit discrimination based on disabilities) allows exemption from mask requirements, but the United States Department of Justice responded that the act \"does not provide a blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations\".There are feelings of mask fatigue among the general public, which is exacerbated by frustrations about people who are not taking the mask and other guidelines seriously as the pandemic and its intensity continues on.\n\n\n=== Trends ===\n\nAmong the European countries surveyed by YouGov in the first half of 2020, the likelihood for people to mask was split: In Northern Europe (e.g., Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark), people were very unlikely to wear a mask. In Western Europe (e.g., Italy, Spain, France, and Germany), people were initially unlikely to use a mask, but mask wearing greatly changed from low levels in March to higher levels in May. A similar, if delayed, pattern was seen in some northern European countries. For example, mask usage was very low in Denmark up until the summer of 2020, but rapidly increased in the autumn as rules on their use in publicly accessible indoor places were introduced. An exception was the United Kingdom where mask usage only grew gradually during in the first half of 2020, but it rose very quickly after official policy changes in July mandated masking in stores.A survey among people from the United States (conducted from April to June 2020) indicates that age was a factor on whether people were likely to wear a mask, as the likelihood rose with the age group, but the reported use of face masks increased significantly across all age groups over time. Furthermore, people who did not report mask use also reported engaging in significantly fewer other mitigation behaviors than those who did report mask use.Gender plays a role in the willingness to wear masks during the pandemic; men are overall less inclined to mask in public than women. There are indications that men are more likely to feel negative emotions (such as shame) and stigma for wearing masks. It is suggested that this male behavior is driven by a sense of masculinity, where the act of masking is possibly perceived to run counter to it, which leads to an increase in men not wearing masks during the pandemic. A survey among participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk about face mask perceptions found that men and women may have different reasons when they do not wear masks in public: Men were more likely to see masks as an infringement upon their independence and women were more likely to perceive masks as being uncomfortable, while perceptions on efficacy, accessibility, compensation, inconvenience, appearance, and attention did not differ.\n\n\n=== Governmental role ===\n\nThe pandemic has raised questions about the role of governments in mask policies, either voluntary or mandatory policies, especially in terms of the social and behavioral consequences involving the general public.The results from a study surveying people in Germany indicate that the act of wearing a mask, independent of the policy, is considered a social contract in which compliant people perceive each other more positively and noncompliance is negatively evaluated. However, it also suggests that voluntary policies have the potential effect to increase polarization and thus cause more stigmatization. The authors recommended that countries and communities should adopt a mandatory policy along with explicit communication of the benefits of both masking (e.g., risk reduction, mutual protection, positive social signaling) and mandatory policies (e.g., fairness, less stigmatization, higher effectiveness) to encourage the public to wear masks.World leaders as role models for masking have also received much scrutiny, as they are key to convey the critical public health message to the public. For example, Slovakia has been cited as a country where its public figures (including President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 and her administration) set the example by wearing masks and played a crucial role to normalize masks. In contrast, in the United States, President Donald Trump and his administration have come under criticism for communicating an inconsistent and confusing message about masking. They have often been criticized for undercutting national and local public health advice to wear masks.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nAlthough authorities, especially in Asia, have been recommending people to wear face masks in public, in many other parts of the world, conflicting advice has caused much confusion among the general population. Several governments and institutions, such as in the United States, initially dismissed the use of face masks by the general population, often with misleading or incomplete information about the usefulness of masks. Commentators have attributed the anti-mask messaging to efforts to manage the mask shortages, as governments did not act quickly enough, remarking that the claims go beyond the science or were simply lies. On 12 June 2020, Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House coronavirus task force, confirmed that the American public were not told to wear masks from the beginning due to the shortages of masks and explained that masks do actually work.In the United States, public masking has become a political issue, as opponents argue that it inhibits personal freedom and proponents emphasize the importance of masks for public health. Some people may see it as a political statement. Party affiliation partly determined how likely people were to embrace the wearing of masks in public. Democrats were more likely to wear masks than Republicans. Masks have become an aspect of the culture war that has emerged over the course of the pandemic. Commentators argue that the resistance against masks partly stems from the confusing and mixed messaging about masking.Matthew Facciani, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University, says the uncertainty from health experts during the early days of the pandemic paved the way for political leaders to become a prominent source for guidance and clarity. He argues that, once mask wearing became informed by political beliefs, it is difficult to correct due to the motivation to protect one's identity in relation to a political group and the reinforcement from political echo chambers, no matter that scientists began to better understand the severity of the virus and the evidence in favor for mask wearing became clearer. Moreover, how people observe the masking rules seems to be different across countries and these differences may be attributed to cultural or management factors.In April 2020, health officials from Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) pushed back on school bullying of boys in pink face masks. The CECC officials and Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung wore pink masks to challenge gender norms at a press conference, while various government agencies demonstrated solidarity by changing the colors on their Facebook pages to pink. The minister later tweeted \"Pink is for everyone and no colour is exclusive for girls or boys. Gender Equality lies at the heart of Taiwan values.\" The press conference was held amid reports that male students were too embarrassed to wear their pink face masks, jeopardizing their safety and the safety of others in the face of COVID-19.\n\n\n=== Opposition ===\n\nIn some countries, large rallies have taken place in protest against masking mandates. In Canada, the anti-mask crowd has hailed their protests as the so-called \"March to Unmask\". In the United Kingdom, new protests came in the wake of the official announcement that masking will be compulsory in shops. After eight months since the beginning of the lockdown in the Czech Republic, mass manifestations against the restrictions imposed by the government arose. Some anti-mask protestors have co-opted the feminist slogan \"my body, my choice\" and the Black Lives Matter slogan \"I can't breathe\". Businesses have also been purposely disrupted by anti-maskers (purportedly in defense of their constitutional rights).According to Moe Gelbart, executive director of the Thelma McMillen Recovery Center, anti-maskers' behaviors do not appear only from the facts they hear, but the problems also come from the meaning they give to those facts. He identifies several key psychological reasons that prompt them to not wear a mask: First, denial is seen in some people who feel worried and anxious by masks as it interferes with their belief and desire that everything is alright. Second is a sense of invulnerability, as some people and especially younger individuals believe nothing bad will happen to them and are thus prone to risk-taking behaviors. Third, behavioral drift is seen among some people who find it difficult to maintain behaviors intended for prevention rather than treatment. Fourth, some people may have issues related to authority due to mistrust of science or tribe identification with powerful figures. Fifth, the act of covering one's face has an association with \"bad\", such as criminals or as an intention to hide something one is ashamed of. Sixth, some people do not want to admit fear and vulnerability, which they associate with the act of wearing a mask.\nIn the United States, opposition to mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic came during then-President Donald Trump's politicization of science and more generally during decades-old period of politicization of science. American opposition to mask-wearing during pandemics is not new; during the 1918 influenza pandemic, the Anti-Mask League was established in San Francisco, California.In May 2021, Vice reported that some members of the anti-vaccine community were, ironically, promoting the use of masks and social distancing to protect themselves from those who have received vaccines, citing false claims that those vaccinated for COVID-19 \"shed\" spike proteins that can be harmful to people in their proximity, and discredited research scientist Judy Mikovits claimed that she had been kicked off a plane for wearing a mask lined with colloidal silver.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChristian clergy from the Lutheran, Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican, Baptist and Latter-day Saint traditions, as well as those from the Jewish, Buddhist and Unitarian religions have implored people to wear masks.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nAs the pandemic progressed people began making use of face masks as accessories, matching them to their outfits and so on. Early in the pandemic, people and businesses from the fashion industry responded to official calls for help in overcoming the shortages of protective personal equipment including face masks. These masks were sheerly utilitarian as the only consideration at the time was function. What began as a public health necessity however gradually evolved into a new category of accessories subject to similar design and marketing considerations as other accessories. Fashion brands eventually reopened their factories for production due to the increasing demand for masks and started to manufacture masks in a wider variety of styles. Smaller brands, who primarily sold their products online, found that selling masks was a good strategy to maintain sales. Etsy became a major online platform where many designers sold their masks. Designers started making masks that matched other pieces of clothing and accessories, a trend which may have begun unintentionally as even fabric remnants were repurposed.The city of Vilnius in Lithuania held a \"Mask Fashion Week\" in May 2020, which was promoted with billboards (with no catwalks or displays) around the city featuring local people including Mayor Remigijus Simasius wearing face masks.The Walt Disney Company introduced uniform face masks for their employees at Walt Disney World and Disneyland in the United States.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nLarge numbers of disposed face masks have led to an increase in plastic waste, negatively impacting the environment. Moreover, the production of face masks also contributes the emission of carbon dioxide, which accelerates global warming. Considering the risk of plastic pollution, researchers have focused on using biodegradable polymers to fabricate facemask with antimicrobial properties \n\n\n=== Linguistic aspects ===\nDue to the rarity of their use in non-medical settings outside East Asia, many languages lacked commonly used terms for facemasks, especially since legal issues prevent the usage of terms which might imply medical standards the masks do not meet. In languages such as Saterland Frisian public competitions were held to create a neologism for the device in the language and thus not having to rely on loanwords or calques. The Friisk Foriining held a similar competition for the North Frisian language.\n\n\n== Comparison by countries and territories ==\n\n Argentina: After the appearance of three asymptomatic cases, the capital Buenos Aires introduced compulsory masking since 14 April 2020. Wearing a mask was made obligatory for everyone on public transit, entering a market and everyone who contacts with the public in their position. Violators can face a fine. Authorities also prohibited the sale of N95 face masks to non-medical workers, suggesting the general public to use home-made masks instead.\n Australia: The federal Department of Health does not recommend the wearing of face masks by the general public when you are well, but in regions where there is community transmission people may choose to, or be required to, wear a mask. However, all states and territories mandate masks in some or all settings as of September 2021. In places where there is community transmission and it is difficult to keep a distance, properly-worn masks are recognized as an important protective measure. First in the state of Victoria, face coverings became compulsory on 22 July 2020 in the metropolitan Melbourne or Mitchell Shire areas when outside of one's home. This was later extended to all of Victoria from 3 August. All states and territories have since then mandated masks at some point in time, depending on the outbreak situation at the location.

Wearing face masks has been required again since 10 September 2020 in public indoor places, including public transportation, and since 21 October 2020 in outdoor public places and cars. While in the spring 2020 the obligation applied unconditionally, even if one was alone in nature or alone in a car (which has been criticized), the autumn measure includes an exception for the case where distances of at least two meters are maintained between people (in outdoor) and for the cases where only members of the same household are nearby.\n Dominican Republic: Since 16 April 2020, the use of face masks is mandatory in all public spaces and in the workplace.\n DR Congo: Since 20 April 2020, wearing masks in the capital of Kinshasa is mandatory.\n Denmark: Except in the first peak of cases in spring 2020, Danish authorities have generally required masks in publicly accessible indoor places during periods with clearly rising or high levels of COVID-19 in the country. On 22 August 2020, as cases had started rising, the use of face masks was made mandatory in public transport. On 29 October 2020, the executive order was extended to include all publicly accessible indoor areas. The requirement was gradually outphased from 14 June to 1 September 2021, but reintroduced 28\u201329 November as the Omicron variant began spreading. In general, Danes have closely followed the recommendations of the national health authorities, with low rates of mask use when not required and high rates of compliance in periods where required.\n Ecuador: On 8 April 2020, the Emergency Operations Committee (COE) decided to make face masks obligatory in public spaces.\n Egypt: On 30 May 2020, the wearing of face masks in public places and on public transportation became mandatory; failure to comply can result in fines of up to EGP4,000 (US$247).\n Ethiopia: The Council of Ministers approved a regulation that outlaws handshakes, and obligates the use of face masks in public places.\n Finland: Initially the Government did not recommend face masks to be used by the general public, but said that they can be used in situations where it is not possible to keep a distance. If someone chooses to wear a mask, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare notes that it is important that it is used correctly, and that general distancing and hygiene guidelines should still be followed. On 13 August 2020, an official recommendation was given to use face masks in public transportation in hospital districts that have had new COVID-19 cases within the previous 14 days.\n France: On 3 March 2020, the government issued a degree announcing requisition of stocks of FFP2 and anti-splash masks until 31 May 2020. On 8 May 2020, the government announced that 200 million masks per week will be available starting on 11 May 2020: 100 million for medical workers and 100 million for the general public.

On 2 April, the Robert Koch Institute, the federal epidemic authority, changed its previous recommendation that only people with symptoms should wear masks to also include people without symptoms. Later in April, Germany made the wearing of cloth face masks mandatory on public transport, as well as for shopping in most German states. Some German states expanded the regulations to include outdoor markets.\n Ghana: Use of face masks would be made mandatory in public spaces including public transport.

From 15 December 2020, the government also started to mandate the wearing of full face shield aside from face mask. Previously, face shield was required in enclosed public areas and several localities.\n Poland: Since 16 April 2020, covering lips and nose was compulsory before leaving one's house (e.g., disposable mask, cloth mask, or scarf). After 30 May 2020, covering lips and nose was obligatory only on public transport and public indoor areas (e.g. shopping centre, medical facilities, libraries.). Since 10 October 2020 masks are obligatory again in every public place excluding parks, fields, forests, beaches.; such mandate was removed outdoor since 15 May 2021.\n Russia: Khabarovsk has made the wearing of face masks obligatory to fight the spike in respiratory diseases and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n Rwanda: On 20 April 2020, Cabinet Minister of Health Daniel Ngamije said the latest guidelines require everyone to wear a mask in public, and at home during the lockdown and thereafter.\n Serbia: Wearing face masks has been required since 29 June 2020 in public indoor places, including public transportation.\n Singapore: Masks were made mandatory from 14 April 2020 in both public transport and all public places, except for people seated in a restaurant or food court with consumption of food and drink. A conviction of this law can lead to a maximum fine of $10,000 and up to one year imprisonment. Subsequent convictions constitute a fine of up to $20,000 and up to five year imprisonment. Prior to that, there was an increase of number of people wearing masks despite being voluntary during COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely that after the COVID-19 pandemic, mask wearing and social distancing will continue to be retained.                                    *  Slovakia: Face masks were compulsory in public transport and shops since 15 March 2020.

As of 15 October 2020 face masks or equivalent face coverings are required everywhere in public spaces (including outdoors) for any of the statistical regions designated as \"red\" (more than 140 confirmed infected per 100k population).\n South Africa: On 10 April 2020, the Minister of Health recommended that the general public use cloth face masks when going out in public (in addition to hand-washing and social distancing). After 1 May 2020, covering one's nose and mouth will be mandatory in public (with a cloth mask, scarf, T-shirt, etc.).\n South Korea: The government implemented a policy of centralized procurement and rationing of face masks, purchasing eighty percent of national production since early March. On 25 May 2020, the Korean government / Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters required everyone to wear masks in all public transport and public places with the surge of COVID-19 cases.\n Spain: Wearing masks has been required since 4 May 2020 while on public transportation, which includes taxis, trains and buses. The government is providing masks to the majority of people riding public transportation, regardless of if they have a mask on. On 9 June 2020, the Spanish Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Transport maintains the mandatory nature of masks on public roads, in open air spaces, and in closed spaces for public use\n Sweden: Sweden's Public Health Agency says the scientific evidence does not support public use of face masks, and that public use of face masks would undermine Sweden's COVID-19 response. The government has also warned that wearing them might create a false sense of security, and that public use of masks could do more harm than good.\n Taiwan: On 21 January 2020, the government announced a temporary ban on the export of face masks. On 6 February 2020, the government instituted a mask rationing system. The ROC has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March 2020. On 1 April 2020, passengers on trains and intercity buses were required to wear face masks, unmasked riders facing a fine.\n Turkey: Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory.\n Ukraine: Since 6 April 2020, wearing a face mask is required by the government in public places. In Kyiv, public places were clarified to include parks and streets.\n United Kingdom: Health is a devolved policy in the United Kingdom, resulting in different policies across the four nations:\n England: From 11 May 2020, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, advised that people wear face coverings in enclosed spaces where 2m social distancing was not possible and when they would come into contact with people who they wouldn't usually meet. On 15 June 2020, wearing a face covering became compulsory on public transport and in healthcare settings. On 24 July 2020, face coverings became compulsory in shops. On 8 August the legal requirement to wear a face covering was extended to other indoor venues such as cinemas, restaurants (unless seated to eat or drink) and places of worship. When the majority of Covid restrictions were ultimately lifted on 19 July 2021, face coverings ceased to be mandatory by law in most settings across England, but businesses were able to implement their own policies. The wearing of face masks continued to be compulsory on Transport for London services beyond this date. The mandate was reinstated on 30 November 2021 for public transport and retail outlets, and for \"most indoor public places\" excluding hospitality venues on 10 December 2021 amid concerns over the omicron variant. It was lifted again on 27 January 2022.\nNorthern Ireland: The wearing of face masks on public transport was compulsory from 10 July. A voluntary request to use face masks in retail stores was introduced on 1 August 2020 but Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill advised this may become mandatory, if sufficient number of people were not wearing them by 20 August. On 24 May 2021 the requirement to use face coverings was extended to all indoor public areas having already been in place in shops.\n Scotland: On 28 April 2020, the First Minister for Scotland Nicola Sturgeon advised the voluntary use of cloth face masks in enclosed spaces such as shops and public transport (but not generally in public), while noting their limitation. The use of face coverings became compulsory on public transport on 22 June 2020 and in shops on 10 July 2020. As of 18 January 2021, face coverings were compulsory on public transport, in shops, and most indoor communal spaces in Scotland.\n Wales: Face masks became compulsory on public transport on Wales on 27 July 2020. In July 2020, First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned people may be turned away from healthcare settings if they refuse to wear a mask when asked. The use of face coverings became mandatory in indoor public areas including shops on 14 September 2020.\n United States: In March 2020, the CDC recommended that if neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, though caution should be exercised when considering this option. On 6 April, the CDC recommended the wearing of non-medical cloth face coverings when in public places. As of 4 August 34 states and the District of Columbia have implemented health orders requiring the wearing of face coverings in most public spaces. On May 14, the CDC suggested that vaccinated individuals could enter indoor venues without wearing masks, a number of states have lifted the mandate.\n Uzbekistan: Officials made protective masks mandatory in all major cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Videos of these incidents, occurring in locations from retail stores to airplanes, have been seen in the news and social media and have frequently gone viral.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOpposition to wearing masks occurred during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The Anti-Mask League of San Francisco was formed by those who refused to wear face masks.  During the pandemic, $5 fines were imposed in San Francisco for failure to wear masks as a violation of \"disturbing the peace\", and many refusing to wear a mask paid the fines.Mask opposition has been a common sight around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic as those opposed to requirements to cover their faces have exhibited protests and unruly behavior in public over their refusal to follow this guideline. On 26 September, 2021, a man surnamed Yang assaulted a female supermarket worker in Gaoshu, Taiwan, who had asked him to put on a mask. He proceeded to gouge her eyes, causing retinal detachment and possible loss of sight. In October 2021, a Taiwanese woman surnamed Chen knived another woman surnamed Wang over 10 times for asking her to put on a mask. Chen was detained for attempted murder but released on bail the same day.\n\n\n== Legal background ==\nThere is no judicial precedent in the United States providing that a governmental entity may require individuals to wear face masks in public settings. However, in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a Massachusetts law that mandated vaccines against smallpox amidst a public health crisis, thereby acknowledging the police power of the States. As for statutes, no federal law requires individuals to wear face masks in an effort to preserve public health. However, the executive branch is authorized to make any regulations necessary in preventing the spread of diseases into and within the United States.Under the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends the wearing of face masks to slow the spread of COVID-19. Following this guidance, President Biden signed an executive order in January 2021 requiring individuals to wear face masks on all federal property. In addition, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires passengers to wear face masks when traveling on all transportation networks. To enforce this rule, the TSA imposes civil penalties on passengers who refuse to wear face masks while traveling on transportation networks throughout the United States.\n\n\n== Reasons ==\nReasons given by people who refuse to wear face masks range significantly, including: potential danger of wearing face masks due to personal health issues, the absence or lack of symptoms of COVID-19 exhibited by the individual, ineffectiveness at reducing COVID-19 transmission, alleged exaggeration of the threats of the virus (some would even argue that it does not exist) while others object to governments having the power to force people to wear face coverings, such as passing certain mandates (not laws) that require the population to wear it. Some people do not wear a face mask on medical grounds and are legally exempt from having to wear one.Mask-wearing has been seen as an example of a generational divide by some, with older adults who refused to wear masks being seen as selfish. In addition, men have been seen as more likely to refuse wearing masks, seeing them as a threat to their masculinity. Refusal to wear face masks is also linked to vaccine hesitancy or anti-vaccination sentiment, political conservatism, rural dwelling, and non-adherence to public hygiene rules, or social distancing guidelines. Other factors which may make people less likely to wear masks includes a low death rate due to pandemic disease in one's hometown, and low mask-wearing among one's peers.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nConsequences for mask refusal or improper mask-wearing can range from anything from public shaming (including calling women who refuse to wear masks \"Karens\"), ejection or banning from an establishment either temporarily or permanently, criminal prosecution, and contracting or spreading a contagious disease such as COVID-19.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIncorrect mask usage\n\n\n== References ==",

In September 2020, it was reported that the government had contemplated leveraging the United States Postal Service to distribute free reusable masks nationwide as early as April, but that it had scrapped the plan due to concerns it could \"create concern or panic\".Mask mandates have been divisive. Republican-led states were, initially, less likely to impose health orders requiring the wearing of masks than Democratic-led states. Several states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Texas, took actions to block localized health orders requiring masks, but later softened their stances to help control local spikes. Some Americans felt mask mandates to be an infringement of their personal liberties, According to a Pew Research survey conducted in fall 2020, 19% of Republican respondents listed masks as a pandemic-related hardship, 27% of whom were skeptical about masks or the severity of the pandemic, compared with 10% of Democrats, 31% of whom expressed anxieties about the politicization of safety regulations and others who were not taking the pandemic seriously.Former President Donald Trump largely resisted wearing masks in public media appearances, and did not mandate their use at his rallies and other public campaign events during the 2020 presidential election.

Biden also issued an executive order mandating the wearing of masks on public transport systems. In April 2021, as the country's vaccination program increased in pace, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance stating that those who were fully vaccinated did not need to wear masks when in small outdoor gatherings. In May 2021, the CDC went further and issued guidance stating that fully vaccinated people did not need to wear masks nor physically distance in public, unless otherwise mandated by local laws or entities. The announcement faced a mixed reception, with critics arguing that this guidance largely relied on an honor system, and may have been premature given the country's progress on vaccination at the time.\nDue to rising cases mainly caused by the more transmissible Delta variant, in July 2021, the CDC issued a recommendation that face masks be worn by anyone in an indoor public space if \"substantial and high transmission\" exists locally.",

In February 2020, Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams stated that proper hygiene and getting a flu vaccine were appropriate preventive actions to be taken by the public, and stated on Twitter that masks should be saved for healthcare professionals, and that they were \"NOT effective in preventing [the] general public from catching Coronavirus\". CDC director Robert R. Redfield also stated that healthy people did not need to wear masks.In a March 8 interview with 60 Minutes, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Anthony Fauci similarly argued that \"when you\u2019re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.\" Fauci again cited the need to conserve supplies of PPE for medical workers and those who were sick.In late March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a recommendation that masks be used by those who are sick, or are caring for someone who is sick and not able to wear a mask themselves, and discouraged their use by healthy members of the general public. This guidance was consistent with that of the World Health Organization (WHO) at the time.\n\n\n==== Recommendations on using masks to reduce transmission ====\n\nIn late-March 2020, some government officials began to focus on the wearing of masks to help prevent transmission of COVID-19 as opposed to protecting the wearer; former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stated in a report that face masks would be \"most effective\" at slowing its spread if widely used (citing Hong Kong and South Korea as examples), as \"they may help prevent people who are asymptomatically infected from transmitting the disease unknowingly\".On March 30, Director of the CDC Robert R. Redfield stated that the organization was evaluating data regarding use of masks by the general public. The next day, President Donald Trump suggested in a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing that scarves or \"something else\" could be worn as face coverings. COVID-19 response coordinator Deborah Birx stated that the task force was discussing the addition of face masks to its guidance.On April 3, 2020, the CDC issued guidance recommending that non-medical face coverings be worn in public when social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as at grocery stores and pharmacies, and especially in areas with significant amounts of community transmission. The CDC published tutorials on making non-medical face masks, including a design only requiring a t-shirt and rubber bands, and no sewing.When asked by National Public Radio about the April 3 reversal, the CDC cited studies from February and March showing presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, and reports from Asian countries regarding the effectiveness of face coverings in this manner. Professor of public health Larry Gostin said that the CDC could have revised its recommendation sooner; by maintaining its initial recommendation throughout March, it had given the public the impression that widespread mask usage was ineffective even though scientific evidence to the contrary was already available. The earlier recommendation damaged the agency's credibility.In a May 27 interview with CNN, Fauci urged Americans to wear face masks in public as a sign of \"respect\" for others, and stated that he had been doing so himself  \"[because] I want to protect myself and protect others, and also because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that's the kind of thing you should be doing.\" On June 5, amid the nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd, Fauci warned that people not wearing face masks in crowds may \"propagate the further spread of infection\".\n\n\n==== Downplaying by the Trump administration ====\nFollowing the change in recommendations by the CDC, President Donald Trump began to publicly downplay the use of face masks; during a media briefing on April 3, he emphasized that the new guidance was voluntary, and that he himself would not follow them. When asked about his stance by a reporter, he explained that \"somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute desk, the great Resolute desk, I think, and wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, [..] I just don't see it for myself.\" \nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence avoided being seen wearing face masks during media events, such as an April 28 visit to the Mayo Clinic by Pence, and a visit by Trump to a Honeywell factory producing respirators. After he was criticized for violating Mayo Clinic policies requiring masks to be worn by staff and visitors, Pence explained that he was being regularly tested negative for COVID-19, and that \"I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible health care personnel, and look them in the eye and say 'thank you'.\"On September 17, 2020, the Washington Post published a report on documents from the United States Postal Service obtained by American Oversight under the Freedom of Information Act, which included a draft press release dated April 2020 announcing that it planned to distribute 650 million reusable masks in five-packs to each residential address in the United States (beginning with areas identified as being hot spots at the time, including New York City and parts of Louisiana and Washington). An anonymous senior official told the Post that the proposed program had been scrapped due to \"concern from some in the White House Domestic Policy Council and the office of the vice president that households receiving masks might create concern or panic.\"When visiting a ventilator factory on April 30, Pence was seen wearing a mask. During a visit to a Ford Motor Company plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan on May 21, Trump wore a cloth mask inscribed with the presidential seal, but took it off before appearing for the media. Trump explained that he did not want to give the press the \"pleasure\" of seeing him wearing a mask.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a warning to Ford for violations of state health orders. In a CNN interview, Nessel called Trump a \"petulant child who refuses to follow the rules\", and suggesting that he did not respect the safety and welfare of his potential voters enough \"just to engage in the very simple task, the painless task, the easy task of wearing a mask when he was provided one.\" On Twitter, Trump accused Nessel of \"taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor\", insinuating that \"they might get upset with you and leave the state, like so many other companies have \u2014 until I came along and brought business back to Michigan.\"\n\n\n===== Trump criticism of Joe Biden =====\nAfter former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wore a black mask and sunglasses during a Memorial Day ceremony (his first major out-of-home appearance in two months), Trump shared a Twitter post by Fox News commentator Brit Hume that ridiculed the outfit, captioned \"This might help explain why Trump doesn\u2019t like to wear a mask in public.\" In an interview the next day, Biden criticized Trump for sharing the post, and for being a bad role model for the American public. He argued that \"presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine.\" During a subsequent media appearance, Trump described Biden's decision as being \"very unusual\", as \"he was standing outside with his wife, perfect conditions, perfect weather.\" He added, \"I thought that was fine. I wasn't criticizing him at all. Why would I do a thing like that?\" After a reporter refused a request by Trump to take off his mask because it had muffled his voice, Trump accused him of \"want[ng] to be politically correct.\"In a June 2020 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump argued that some people were wearing masks to \"signal disapproval\" of him, and said of Biden's use of masks, \"It's like he put a knapsack over his face. He probably likes it that way. He feels good that way because he does. He seems to feel good in a mask, you know, feels better than he does without the mask, which is a strange situation.\"\n\n\n===== In-person campaign events =====\nTrump returned to holding public campaign events for his 2020 re-election campaign in mid-June 2020, beginning with a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20. Masks were optional, and not worn by the majority of participants, nor was social distancing enforced.Trump then appeared at a Students for Trump event in Phoenix, Arizona on June 23. Despite the state of Arizona had recently become a major hotspot for new COVID-19 cases, and Phoenix having enacted a health ordinance requiring the wearing of masks in public, Mayor Kate Gallego stated that the city would \"[not] be focused on enforcement during the rally.\" The owners of the megachurch where the event took place announced that it had installed an ionizing air purifier system that could \"kill 99.9% of the virus\". The claimed efficacy was disputed by the media. Once again, the majority of attendees did not wear masks.On July 3, Trump also made an appearance at an Independence Day fireworks event at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota (a state that had been known for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic with few public health orders), where masks were once again optional, and social distancing was explicitly left unenforced.By contrast, Biden's campaign employed more \"drive-in\" rallies, and smaller-scale gatherings with social distancing and mask usage.\n\n\n==== Brief change in stance ====\nDuring a Coronavirus Task Force briefing on June 26 amidst major resurgences of cases in California and multiple Southern states, most of the participants wore masks when not at the podium. However, Pence did not wear a mask, nor did he mention the wearing of masks or social distancing when recapping the government's hygiene recommendations. On June 28 in an interview on This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued that \"the president should be an example. Real men wear masks.\"On July 1 in an interview with Fox Business, Trump stated he was \"all for masks\", but questioned the implementation of a national mandate since they would apply in \"places in the country where people stay very long distance.\" Trump stated he had \"no problem\" wearing a mask in public if he were \"in a group of people where we're not 10 feet away \u2014 but usually I'm not in that position and everyone's tested.\" On July 5, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows stated that a national mandate was \"not in order\", since they are \"[used] on a location basis when you can't have social distancing\".\n\nA Trump campaign event in New Hampshire originally scheduled on July 11, by contrast, was to be held outdoors, and the wearing of masks was now listed as \"strongly encouraged\" (although the event would later be postponed, with the White House citing Tropical Storm Fay as justification). On July 11, Trump publicly wore a mask for the first time when visiting members of the military at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Prior to the event, Trump told Sean Hannity that \"it's fine to wear a mask out if it makes you feel comfortable\", and later commented that hospitals were a location where one is generally expected to wear a mask under these conditions.On July 14, First Lady Melania posted a photo of herself wearing a mask on social media, urging her followers to follow CDC guidance since \"the more precaution we take now can mean a healthier & safer country in the Fall.\" In a CBS News interview the same day, Trump stated that \"if it's necessary, I would urge [Americans] to wear a mask and I would say follow the guidelines.\"In an interview with Fox News Sunday that aired July 19, Trump told Chris Wallace that he was a \"believer\" in masks, but that he did not intend to enact a federal mandate (leaving it to state governors) because \"I want people to have a certain freedom\". He also disagreed with CDC Director Redfield's suggestion that the use of masks nationwide could bring the U.S. epidemic under control within weeks, and accused federal health officials of having been inconsistent with their guidance on masks over the course of the pandemic.On July 20, Trump posted a photo of himself in a mask on Twitter, captioned \"We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can\u2019t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!\" The next day during a press briefing, Trump again encouraged the wearing of masks by Americans, stating \"whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.\" It was reported that Trump's advisers had recommended this shift in order to re-gain public approval for his handling of the pandemic.\n\n\n==== Continued downplaying by the Trump administration ====\nDuring the 2020 Republican National Convention, speeches were held on the South Lawn of the White House. A crowd of 1,500 invited guests were present for Trump's acceptance speech on the final night, who did not wear masks or practice social distancing. When questioned by CNN about the crowd, an official argued that \"everybody is going to catch this thing eventually.\" Although Washington D.C. health orders at the time prohibited gatherings of more than 50 people, this does not extend to federal property. At a campaign rally on September 3 in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Trump continued to mock Biden for wearing masks during campaign appearances \u2014 suggesting that it gave him a \"feeling of security\", but that \"If I were a psychiatrist, I'd say this guy has some big issues.\" He asked the audience, \"did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him?'On September 21, 2020,  William Crews, a public affairs official at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), stepped down from his position after The Daily Beast published a report that identified him as a pseudonymous managing editor of the conservative website RedState. He had authored several posts promoting COVID-19 disinformation and criticizing masks, which argued they were a \"political statement\", and referred to Anthony Fauci as a \"mask nazi\".\n\n\n==== White House outbreak and aftermath ====\n\nOn September 26, 2020, Trump held an outdoor ceremony at the White House Rose Garden to announce Amy Coney Barrett as his nomination to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court, left by Ruth Bader Ginsburg following her death on September 18. It was observed that social distancing was not practiced, and a large number of the 150 participants (including several senior officials) did not wear masks. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar was an exception, but was then seen taking off his mask and physically interacting with others as he left. The HHS stated that Azar and the people he interacted with had all tested negative prior to the event. Two indoor receptions were also held.Despite a spokesperson stating that all attendees in proximity to Trump had been tested before the event, guests from Barrett's alma mater Notre Dame (who were seated in the front row) reported that they were not, and stated that they were not told by the White House that tests were a prerequisite. Furthermore, the White House stated that attendees did not need to wear masks if they had tested negative.On September 30, Trump's senior counselor Hope Hicks (who had traveled with Trump) tested positive for COVID-19, but the case was not publicized until an interview with Trump on Fox News's Hannity the next evening. During the interview, Trump stated that he and Melania had just been tested. Several hours later, Trump announced on Twitter that he and Melania had both tested positive.By October 2, at least seven attendees of the ceremony had tested positive, also including senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, University of Notre Dame president John I. Jenkins (who had apologized after the event for his failure to wear a mask), and an unnamed journalist. This resulted in scrutiny of the ceremony as a superspreader event by the media and local officials, due to the lack of precautions generally taken by its participants. Infectious disease physician Robert L. Murphy argued that if the ceremony was responsible for the White House outbreak, general use of masks and social distancing could have prevented it.\n\n\n==== Presidential debates and town halls ====\nAt the first presidential debate on September 29, First Lady Melania and other members of Trump's family were seen taking off masks after seating themselves in the audience\u2014violating health protocols specified by the Cleveland Clinic that had been agreed upon by both parties, calling for masks to be worn at the debate by all attendees (excluding the two candidates and the moderator when on-stage).  During the debate, Trump once again mocked Biden for his use of face masks, stating \"I don't wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from them, and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.\" Debate moderator Chris Wallace later stated that Trump and his personnel were not tested prior to the debate in Cleveland since they arrived late, and that they were admitted under \"an honor system\".In an October 2020 town hall held by NBC News, President Trump incorrectly claimed a CDC study found that 85% of people who wore masks had still contracted COVID-19. The data originated from a \"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\" published by the CDC, which contained a survey on behaviors exhibited by COVID patients and a control group of those who tested negative: While around 70% of both groups surveyed did say they always wore a mask, the COVID-positive patients were more likely to have engaged in close contact and activities \"where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain\" within the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, such as visiting a bar or restaurant. Misinformation related to this report has also been promoted by social network posts and Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson.During a rally on October 29, Trump made remarks to the crowd promoting mask use when social distancing is not possible; \"If you get close, wear a mask. 'Oh, it's controversial.' It's not controversial to me.\"\n\n\n=== 2021 ===\n\n\n==== Transition to the Biden administration ====\n\nOn January 20, 2021, in one of his first actions as president following his inauguration, Joe Biden signed Executive Order 13991, which compels the heads of executive departments and agencies to \"immediately take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to require compliance with CDC guidelines with respect to wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, and other public health measures\" by visitors and employees of federal land and properties, and commands the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"engage\" with political leaders and community members to \"[maximize] public compliance with, and addressing any obstacles to, mask-wearing and other public health best practices identified by CDC\".The next day, Biden signed another executive order, compelling the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and other federal agencies to require the wearing of face masks on all forms of public transportation, including planes, trains, buses, ships, and airports.  On April 30, the TSA extended this order through September 13.\n\n\n==== Issuance of guidance for vaccinated individuals ====\nOn April 27, 2021, Biden and the CDC announced amended guidance on masks, stating that those who are fully vaccinated (14 days after the second dose of a twin-dose vaccine, or 14 days after receiving a single-dose vaccine) did not need to wear a mask during small outdoor gatherings, but that they should still be worn at large outdoor gatherings (such as concerts and sporting events) where large numbers of unvaccinated people may be present, and that vaccinated people should still avoid large indoor gatherings.On May 11, Rochelle Walensky \u2014 the CDC's new director under the Biden administration \u2014 appeared before the Senate Committee on Health. Amid questioning by Republican senators such as Maine's Susan Collins, Walensky defended the CDC's current guidance on topics such as masks, stating that the public must \"maintain public health measures we know will prevent the spread of this virus\" as long as community transmission exists. Unbeknownst to the panel, the CDC was already finalizing new guidance, which would be publicly announced two days later.\n\n\n==== CDC drops mask recommendations for the fully-vaccinated ====\nOn May 13, 2021, the CDC announced new guidance, stating that those who are fully vaccinated do not need to wear a mask or practice social distancing, unless otherwise required by health orders or private entities (such as on all public transportation, and where mandates still exist). In a briefing discussing the change, Biden emphasized that the country still had to work towards its goal of having 70% of its adult population receive at least one vaccine dose by Independence Day, but felt that those who have been fully vaccinated had \"earned the right to do something that Americans are known for all around the world \u2014 greeting others with a smile.\" He also asked Americans to respect the decisions of those who may still wear masks as a personal decision; \"We have had too much conflict, too much bitterness, too much anger, too much politicization of this issue about wearing masks. Let's put it to rest.\"The White House and other federal departments began to implement the new guidance for their staff over the days that followed. The abruptness of the announcement caught many state and local health officials, as well as some federal employees, off-guard. Citing the new guidance, many states allowed their mask mandates to expire, while Costco and Walmart also announced that, where allowed, they would exempt vaccinated individuals from their corporate mask mandates.The new guidance faced criticism for being premature and largely relying on an honor system, as it would be difficult to determine whether someone is fully vaccinated without documentation, only around 36% of Americans had been fully vaccinated at that point, and loosening guidance on masks would encourage complacency by those who are against masks and/or vaccines (who could falsely claim that they were vaccinated). The federal government had ruled out implementing a national framework for immunity passports due to human rights and privacy concerns, while multiple states have prohibited them outright.In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Walensky denied that the CDC had bowed to political pressure to loosen restrictions, and stated that the new guidance was based on evolving science and newly-obtained data, including studies on the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines in the U.S., and another study showing a reduction in viral load among patients that had still contracted COVID-19 after being vaccinated. Others felt that the announcement was an attempt by the Biden administration to distract from the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack and the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict. A White House spokesperson stated that the decision had been made solely by the CDC, as part of its current mandate under the Biden administration to operate \"based on the science and data, free from political influence\".On May 20, amid an increasing number of states lifting their mask mandates entirely due to the guidance, Fauci told Axios that he thought many Americans were misinterpreting the guidance, stating that \"[the CDC] said: If you are vaccinated, you can feel safe \u2014 that you will not get infected either outdoors or indoors. It did not explicitly say that unvaccinated people should abandon their masks.\"\n\n\n==== Reinstatement of mask recommendations and mandates ====\nOn June 30, 2021, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LADPH) reintroduced a strong recommendation that all residents wear face masks within indoor public spaces, even if they are vaccinated. The recommendation came only 15 days after California had lifted its remaining public health orders and mask mandate; officials stated that the recommendation was issued due to increasing spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant in the region, and due to the Department investigating reports of breakthrough infections in Israel that involved Delta variant.On July 15, LADPH announced that it would reintroduce a mask mandate effective at midnight on July 18. This applies to all indoor public spaces in Los Angeles County, even if vaccinated. County health officer Muntu Davis stated that \"we\u2019re not where we need to be for the millions at risk of infection here in Los Angeles County, and waiting to do something will be too late given what we're seeing now.\"On July 25, Fauci stated in an interview that the U.S. was heading in the \"wrong direction\" due to Delta variant and low vaccination numbers in parts of the country, and that the CDC was \"actively considering\" revising its guidance. By July 26, several other areas had also reintroduced mask mandates regardless of vaccination, including Provincetown, Massachusetts, Savannah, Georgia, St. Louis County, Missouri, and Clark County, Nevada for all public-facing employees of businesses.The next day, citing Delta variant and the possibility that it can be spread easily even by those who are vaccinated, the CDC issued new guidance recommending that in regions where there is \"substantial and high transmission\" of COVID-19, face masks should be worn within indoor public spaces even if vaccinated. The CDC also recommended that masks be mandated at schools for all students and faculty, again regardless of vaccination status (for those approved to receive them). Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated that \"we are dealing with a much different strain of this virus than we were even earlier in the spring, back in May, when the masking guidance was provided by the CDC at that time.\"\n\n\n== Federal policy ==\n\n\n=== Calls for federal policies ===\nThe United States Department of Health and Human Services organized a program known as \"Project: America Strong\", to fund the distribution of reusable masks to \"critical infrastructure sectors, companies, healthcare facilities, and faith-based and community organizations.\"There were calls for a mask mandate to be implemented nationwide at the federal level: the Retail Industry Leaders Association criticized the patchwork of differing regulations (or lack thereof) between regions, and argued that \"despite compliance from the majority of Americans, retailers are alarmed with the instances of hostility and violence front-line employees are experiencing by a vocal minority of customers who are under the misguided impression that wearing a mask is a violation of their civil liberties.\" Goldman Sachs projected that such a mandate \"could potentially substitute for lockdowns that would otherwise subtract nearly 5% from GDP.\"  The Public Health Service Act grants the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services authority to implement regulations to \"prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases\" into U.S. states or possessions, but it is unclear whether this could be used to implement a general mask mandate.On June 28, House Speaker Pelosi stated that such a mandate was \"long overdue\", but that the CDC did not issue one as to not \"offend the president.\" On July 1, Trump questioned the appropriateness of a national mandate since they would apply in \"places in the country where people stay very long distance.\" On July 5, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows stated that a national mandate was \"not in order\", arguing that masks were \"[used] on a location basis when you can't have social distancing\". On July 12, Surgeon General Adams similarly argued that \"if we are going to have a mask mandate we need to understand that works best at the local and state level along with education\", and questioned if a national order could be reasonably enforced without \"having a situation where you're giving people one more reason to arrest a black man.\"On July 12, Surgeon General Adams stated that health officials were trying to \"correct\" their previous messaging, explaining that it was based on an earlier presumption that those who were asymptomatic were less likely to transmit COVID-19. He explained that Americans needed \"to understand we follow the science and when we learn more our recommendations change, but it is hard when people are continuing to talk about things from three, four months ago\"; a clip of the aforementioned 60 Minutes interview with Fauci (where he was quoted as saying \"There's no reason to be walking around with a mask\") had often been presented on social media by opponents of face masks as misinformation in support of their arguments. Fauci's statements were consistent with the CDC's guidance at the time, but did not align with current guidance.On July 14, the House Committee on Appropriations adopted an amendment to its Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies funding bill for fiscal year 2021, which would include a mandate for passengers and employees of air travel, Amtrak, and \"large transit agencies\" to wear masks. The bill is scheduled to be voted on by the House of Representatives later in the month. The same day, the CDC published a study indicating that the use of masks by two employees of a Missouri hair salon who showed COVID-19 symptoms and later tested positive, as well as the 139 clients they served before their positive tests, \"was likely a contributing factor\" in preventing their clients from contracting COVID-19 from the employees. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) also published an interview with CDC Director Redfield, where he estimated that the epidemic in the U.S. could be brought under control within four to eight weeks \"if we could get everybody to wear a mask right now\".On July 15, Senator Dianne Feinstein proposed that economic stimulus funding be withheld from states that do not adopt a health order requiring the wearing of masks in public. In a July 19 interview with Fox News Sunday, President Trump stated that he did not intend to enact a federal mask mandate, citing the preservation of personal freedoms.On July 30, Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative of California Ro Khanna introduced the Masks for All Act, a proposed bill that would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce \"high-quality\", reusable face masks for nationwide distribution at no charge (via mail distribution and public pickup locations), with a goal to give three masks each to every individual in the country, and a particular focus on serving the homeless and people who live in communal environments. The total cost of the bill was estimated to be $5 billion, with Khanna noting that \"If we can afford a $740 billion defense budget, we can afford to send every American a face mask. And if we\u2019re asking folks to wear a mask, which is absolutely essential, it\u2019s on us to provide one.\" On July 31,  Peter DeFazio and Rick Larsen introduced the Healthy Flights Act, which would authorize the FAA to mandate the wearing of face masks at airports and while on flights.During an August 2020 campaign appearance, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden proposed a national mask mandate of at least three months as part of his platform, explaining that it could \"save over 40,000 lives [...] if people act responsibly\", and that \"it's not about your rights, it's about your responsibilities as an American.\" On September 16, Biden stated that he believed the president had the legal authority to mandate masks nationwide via an executive order. However, during a CNN town hall the next day, Biden stated that he could not mandate masks nationwide, but could do so for federal property, and that he would urge governors to follow suit at the state level.On September 16, Redfield testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee that masks were the country's \"most powerful public health tool\", as they had \"clear scientific evidence\" that they worked. He explained that \"This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70%, and if I don\u2019t get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. This face mask will.\"\n\n\n=== Action by the Biden administration ===\n\nOn January 20, 2021,  Biden signed an executive order requiring executive departments and agencies to enforce compliance with COVID-19-related guidance issued by the CDC, such as the wearing of face masks by the visitors and staff of federal land.On January 21, 2021, Biden signed another executive order mandating masks be worn in compliance with CDC recommendations on all forms of public transportation, including planes, trains, buses, ships, and airports.\n\n\n== Supply ==\nThe provision and shipment of PPE to other countries such as China contributed to an early shortage of masks and other supplies in the United States, and was criticized by Democratic officials. Forbes.com senior contributor David DiSalvo reported that on March 30 \"roughly 280 million masks from warehouses around the U.S. had been purchased by foreign buyers and were earmarked to leave the country\". The next day, Vice President Mike Pence suspended the export of protective supplies from the stockpiles of the USAID program in order to investigate. The Trump administration denied that the exported stock came from the national stockpile, and stated that it had come from private donations.On April 2, Trump announced that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to compel 3M, General Electric, and Medtronic to increase their production of N95 respirators. By September 2020, N95 respirators were still in short supply. Even though 3M had increased domestic production from 20 million to 95 million respirators a month, they said \"the demand is more than we, and the entire industry, can supply for the foreseeable future.\" Health care workers continued to express fears of shortages.Small U.S.-based manufacturers who invested in manufacturing infrastructure and successfully navigated a nine-month federal approval process reported in February 2021 that they were unable to find buyers for the tens of millions of masks they had produced. The advertising of these masks has been banned on platforms like Google and Facebook and medical supply distributors, hospital systems and state governments, the main purchasers of masks, are wary of locally manufactured masks, which are more expensive than the ones produced in China. Testifying before Congress about the need to support domestic mask manufacturers, one industry executive called the dependence on foreign manufacture \"a national security problem\".By February 2021, suppliers had increased production of medical masks, and some manufacturers reported a surplus. 3M and Honeywell had increased their production of N95 respirators to around 120 million each month, but the health sector is estimated to need around 3.5 billion masks each year, and the limited production is directly sent to the medical distributors that supply large hospital systems. Overall shortages were still reported because some hospitals expected healthcare workers to reuse their masks, even as they were building up stockpiles in anticipation of future need. Hospital purchasers were poorly connected with new suppliers, hesitant to buy from new manufacturers, or resistant to pay higher prices for domestic products. Counterfeits also continued to pose problems for purchasers.N95 manufacturers and other companies were reluctant to invest more in domestic mask production because domestic manufacture in the United States is not profitable. There are some American companies who can shift production temporarily to meet the demand for masks but most of them have not received any funding through the DPA. Some have taken the initiative but experienced problems with the fit of the masks and obtaining regulatory approvals. 3M and other N95 manufacturers have not entered into any corporate partnerships to share intellectual property or increase N95 production.\n\n\n=== Theft ===\nThefts of face masks and other personal protective equipment were reported at hospitals in the United States.The Naval Medical Center San Diego implemented random bag checks for staff members, after several incidents of theft. Thefts of N95 masks were reported from a locked hospital office in South Carolina and off loading docks at the University of Washington. A hospital employee in Cooperstown, New York was charged with misdemeanor larceny for a similar incident.\n\n\n=== Counterfeit masks ===\nThe third-party market was still inundated with a deluge of counterfeit masks in February 2021, one year into the pandemic. Federal agents seized over 10 million fake 3M-branded masks in early 2021. Some were purchased by hospitals even though the masks did not come from authorized distributors. The masks are sold at higher prices than the authentic 3M masks, which retail at around $1.27 each. 3M filed multiple lawsuits against unauthorized sellers for endangering the lives of medical workers. The company issued a statement to say \"This is not a problem that is going away\".\n\n\n== Attitudes ==\n\n\n=== Protection of others ===\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public wearing of face masks to protect others from the spread of infectious disease was not a widely accepted phenomenon in the United States, and had historically been more prevalent in East Asian countries.\n\n\n=== Political views ===\nThe issue of whether or not to wear a mask in public became, for some, a dividing line in the culture war. Politico described progressives as considering masks \"a sign that you take the pandemic seriously and are willing to make a personal sacrifice to save lives\". Supporters of the CDC's recommendations derided what they described as their opponents' ignorance, selfishness, antiscience stance, and lack of respect for fellow citizens.\n\nMasks were cited as a means of controlling COVID-19 without the need to reimpose stay-at-home orders and business closures (which would cause further economic strain). Opponents have invoked conspiracy theories in an attempt to discredit proponents, and have accused proponents of violating their freedoms and of inhibiting development of herd immunity. The wearing of face masks has also been seen by opponents as virtue signaling for liberal values, and as a symbol of intimidation, social control, and opposition towards President Trump.While these health orders usually have exceptions for those with medical conditions (such as breathing problems) or disabilities that would make it difficult to wear a mask, false flyers distributed via social media encouraged people to claim to businesses requiring masks that they have a medical condition protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act, but that under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), they are not required to disclose the medical condition. The HIPAA is a data protection law for the health care industry, and does not actually apply in this manner.Opposing views against masks have also been promoted by conservative media outlets such as Fox News, and radio host Rush Limbaugh \u2014 who argued that masks were a \"required symbol on the left to promote fear, to promote indecision, to promote the notion that we\u2019re nowhere near out of this\". Initially in March 2020, Fox News pundits Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham endorsed the wearing of masks, with Carlson explaining that they were \"key\" to controlling COVID-19 in East Asian countries, while also criticizing the CDC for initially discouraging their use by the general public. After the practice became politicized, however, both pundits began to display opposition to masks on-air: in May 2020, Carlson criticized Fauci for his fluctuating guidance on masks, and claimed that there was no scientific basis for a mask mandate issued in Los Angeles (referring to its residents as being \"hostages\" of Mayor Eric Garcetti). Some Fox News pundits however,  including Sean Hannity and Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, have been more receptive to masks on-air.The Washington Post reported that in an April 2020 poll, 79% of self-identified Democrats and 59% of Republicans stated that they had worn a mask or other face covering in public. Those who knew someone who had been infected with COVID-19 were 40% more likely to wear a mask in public than those who didn't. A Gallup poll the same month found that 75% of Democrats and 48% of Republicans had worn a mask outside in the past week. In a June 2020 survey by Politico and Morning Consult, 60% of those who said they supported the wearing of masks also stated that their opinion of the Trump administration was \"very favorable\".In late-June 2020, amidst a major surge in cases in multiple states (especially in the Sun Belt), support towards masks abruptly emerged among prominent Senate and House Republicans, in an effort to counter resistance towards the practice from President Trump. In a June 28 interview on Face the Nation, Pence recommended that Americans follow the advice of local health officials in regards to wearing masks, as \"every state has a unique situation.\" Other prominent Republicans also began to abruptly support masks and urge Trump to be a role model for his supporters, including chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Lamar Alexander and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Alexander commented that \"this simple lifesaving practice has become part of a political debate that says: If you're for Trump, you don't wear a mask. If you're against Trump, you do\", and argued that Trump could \"help end this political debate\".A Politico survey in July 2020 found that there was now bipartisan majority support for mask mandates, with 72% of those surveyed saying that they strongly or somewhat supported state-wide mask mandates that that are punishable by fines or jail, with 53% expressing strong support. This included 86% of self-identified Democrats surveyed, 58% of self-identified Republicans surveyed, and 68% of self-identified independents surveyed.During a rally on September 21, 2020, an attempt by Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jon A. Husted to promote Trump 2020 and Make America Great Again-branded face masks as campaign merchandise (as part of a stated goal to \"[try] to make masks in America great again\") to the crowd was met with boos, to which he remarked that they had \"made [their] point\".Opposition to the practice of wearing face masks, and to orders mandating face mask use, has led to historical comparisons with the Anti-Mask League of San Francisco that was active during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918\u201319.\n\n\n=== Among minorities ===\n\nConcerns surrounding the politicization of masks have been especially prominent among minority communities, such as African and Asian Americans. Concerns were raised by African Americans that the wearing of masks may encourage racial profiling due to their association with their use by criminals to conceal identity, such as an officer shown handcuffing a black doctor wearing a mask steps from his home, and a police officer in Illinois following two black men wearing surgical masks as they exited a Walmart, and falsely claiming that the city prohibited the wearing of masks. There have also been incidents of bullying, discrimination, and ethnic violence and insults against Asian Americans who wear masks, as part of ongoing anti-Asian sentiment tied to the pandemic due to its Mainland Chinese origin.The April 2020 poll found that 32% of Hispanic and Latino Americans surveyed, and 30% of African Americans surveyed, were concerned that wearing a mask would cause them to be mistaken for a criminal, as opposed to 19% each of Asian Americans and whites. Despite this, larger proportions of people among minority communities said they had worn a mask in public than whites (66%), at 71% of Hispanic and Latino Americans surveyed, 74% of African Americans surveyed, and 82% of Asian Americans surveyed.In late-May and early-June 2020, masks printed with slogans related to the Black Lives Matter and police reform movements (such as \"I can't breathe\") attracted popularity amidst nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd. In June 2020, the United States Postal Inspection Service temporarily seized a shipment of face masks with the slogan \"STOP KILLING BLACK PEOPLE\", ordered by the Movement for Black Lives for distribution to those attending demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York City, St. Louis, and Washington D.C.. The Service stated that there \"were indications that they contained non-mailable matter.\"Citing these concerns over racial profiling, Lincoln County, Oregon (whose population is 95% white) initially announced that it would provide an exemption for people of color from the county's mask mandate. However, following criticism, the county backtracked on June 24. Officials stated that \"The expressions of racism regarding the exception has created a ripple of fear throughout our communities of color. The very policy meant to protect them, is now making them a target for further discrimination and harassment.\"\n\n\n=== Confrontations over mask requirements ===\nThere were incidents of violent confrontations and assaults over disagreements about the masking policies of states and private businesses. Numerous reports were made of retail patrons assaulting employees at retail store's over disagreements about the store's masking policies.  A man was arrested in October 2020 for threatening to kidnap and murder the mayor of Wichita, Kansas over the city's mask mandate.By September 2020, over 170 transit workers in New York City had reported being assaulted or harassed for asking passengers to wear face masks, including a 62-year-old man who was knocked unconscious on his route through East New York, Brooklyn, prompting officials to implement a $50 fine for riders who refused to wear a face mask.There were also instances of assault against persons who refused to comply with masking policies. In Key Largo, a bus driver was arrested for swinging a metal rod at a passenger who lowered his mask to make a call on his cell phone.\n\n\n=== Appearance of vulnerability ===\nRefusal to wear a mask in public may be driven by a fear of being seen as vulnerable and fearful of COVID-19. In a May 2020 survey of 2,459 Americans conducted by Valerio Capraro of Middlesex University London and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Barcelo of the Mathematical Science Research Institute, it was found that men surveyed were more likely to display negative stigmas towards wearing masks in public, including being more likely to agree that it was \"uncool\", \"shameful\", and a \"sign of weakness\". Capraro noted that these stigmas were more prevalent among residents of areas that had mandated the wearing of face masks.Reporting on the study, Ben Boskovich of Esquire wrote that \"the phrase toxic masculinity gets thrown around a lot, sometimes more than necessary, if we're being honest. But this thing, this reality, that men are too blinded by their own inherent privilege to acknowledge their vulnerabilities, to admit they're wrong, to let go of the steering wheel, is as real as the president's hats are red.\".\n\n\n=== Attempts to incentivize usage ===\nBefore eventually mandating them across all properties nationwide, and Nevada announced its state-wide order, Caesars Entertainment attempted a promotion at its casinos in Las Vegas, where rewards members could win $20 credits if spotted wearing a mask on the casino floor.\n\n\n== Mask use and policies by state ==\n\nBy mid-November 2020, 37 states had some sort of health order requiring the wearing of face masks or a similar non-medical face covering when in public spaces or specific types of establishments. Absent a state-level mandate, some municipalities and counties have instituted their own mandates via localized by-laws.These orders usually have exceptions for younger children, as well as those with medical conditions (such as breathing problems) or disabilities that would make it difficult to wear a mask. They are also usually considered an exception to prohibitions on the wearing of masks in public for the purpose of identity concealment, such as general anti-mask laws, and restrictions on wearing masks while carrying a concealed firearm.Some states, such as Louisiana, Oregon, and Washington, at first only mandated the wearing of masks by the public-facing employees of businesses, before mandating they be used by the general public as well.\n\n\n=== Enforcement and challenges ===\nViolations of mandatory mask orders have often classified as a misdemeanor offence, with some states threatening fines for individuals who do not comply. Some states expressly require businesses to enforce mask mandates, with failure to do so also punishable by fines, and in some cases, being ordered to temporarily close, or have their business license revoked.Whether these mandates are actually enforced may vary; some sheriffs in California, Nevada, North Carolina, and Washington state pledged that they would not enforce the orders; one such sheriff in Lewis County, Washington announced to a crowd outside a church, \"don't be a sheep\". By contrast, Governor of California Gavin Newsom threatened to withhold COVID-19 relief funding from counties that do not sufficiently enforce state health orders, including its mask mandate. In late-June 2020, Governor of South Carolina Henry McMaster argued that the inability to effectively enforce such an order influenced his decision to not implement an order at that time, stating that \"there's no power on Earth that can follow everyone in the state around to be sure that they are following the rules.\" However, on July 29, McMaster reversed his prior stance and issued a state-wide mandate, as part of an order taking affect August 3 that also allowed more businesses to resume operations.On October 2, the Michigan Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Governor Gretchen Whitmer had violated the state Emergency Management Act of 1976 by redeclaring a state of emergency to bypass the Republican-controlled Legislature after it declined to renew it. In a split decision, they ruled that the Emergency Powers of Governor Act of 1945 was unconstitutional because it violated the nondelegation doctrine. Governor Whitmer has argued that the decision was still subject to a 21-day reconsideration period, during which the orders still stand, and later accused the Court of undermining her efforts to control the pandemic. On October 4, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel stated that she would stop enforcing COVID-19-related executive orders. On October 12, the Court denied a notion requested by Governor Whitmer for a transition period, thereby voiding all executive orders issued pursuant to the claimed state of emergency. The state Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) had already begun to issue its own orders to supplant Whitmer's voided orders, under powers that give its director the authority to \"establish procedures\" and restrict gatherings during an epidemic. In turn, the MDHHS was sued by a chiropractor (one which had faced warnings from local officials for defying the mask mandate), claiming it did not have the authority to mandate masks.In Wisconsin, Governor Tony Evers similarly re-declared a public health emergency (which is similarly limited to 60 days without legislative approval) to extend its mask mandate beyond its original period (which began August 1). It was challenged in a state court by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, who requested a temporary injunction. Judge Michael Waterman ruled in favor of Governor Evers, stating that \"the 60-day limit provides an important check against run-away executive power, but it does not prevent the governor from issuing a new executive order when the emergency conditions continue to exist.\"When Cook County, Illinois passed a mandate requiring patrons at restaurants, gyms and other retail stores to show proof of vaccination, one of the county's local villages, Orland Park, refused to enforce it. Keith Pekau, mayor of the village, remained defiant during the pandemic, even suing Illinois\u2019 governor in federal court over business lockdowns.\n\n\n=== Political stances ===\n\nOpponents of mask mandates have sometimes argued that they are unconstitutional; the American Bar Association cited that there was precedent under the Tenth Amendment (which states that any powers not granted to the federal government via the Constitution are reserved to states) that state governments \"have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions.\" Jacobson v. Massachusetts has also been cited as case law supporting mask orders; it found that the use of police power by states to enforce health orders designed to maintain the safety of their communities (such as, in this case, mandatory vaccinations for smallpox), did not violate individual liberties under the Fourteenth Amendment.In June 2020, The Hill noted that Democratic-led and coastal states had been more likely to have implemented or considered such mandates over Republican-led states (especially in the conservative South)\u2014which have cited desires to preserve individual liberties, and, in some cases, also took steps to overrule local health orders that are stricter than those imposed by the state (including mask mandates). Not all Republican-led states refused to do so, however, with noted early examples including Maryland and Massachusetts.  Following a major spike in mid-June attributed to the rushed lifting of mitigations around the Memorial Day weekend, Arizona and Texas began to backpedal on their outright prohibition of local orders on the wearing of masks, and Governor of Texas Greg Abbott then issued a state-wide mandate on July 2.On July 15, Governor of Georgia Brian Kemp signed an executive order to prohibit any county or municipality from enacting or enforcing a health order requiring the wearing of masks in public spaces. He also filed a lawsuit against Mayor of Atlanta Keisha Lance Bottoms and her city council over a local health order requiring masks, and voluntarily rolling back to \"Phase 1\" guidelines (discouraging dine-in restaurants), asserting that she \"does not have the legal authority to modify, change or ignore Governor Kemp's executive orders.\" On August 13, however, Kemp dropped the lawsuit, and announced the next day that localized mask mandates would be allowed if certain \"health metrics\" and other guidelines are met, and requiring business owners to consent if the mandate is to apply to businesses.In Kansas, a July 2020 mask mandate by Democratic governor Laura Kelly included the ability for counties to opt out if they (per consultation with health officials) assert that it is not medically necessary; the provision was described as a \"bipartisan compromise\" to gain support from the state's Republican-majority government. By July 9, 90 of Kansas's 105 counties had opted out, while several cities in counties that did opt out, such as Manhattan, Wichita, and Winfield, would enact municipal mandates. Out of a sample of counties, 15 counties that chose to enforce the order were shown to have a reduced rate of new cases than those which opted out. Research released in October 2020 by the University of Kansas found that these trends had continued in the, by then, 21 counties that implemented the order. The mayor of Dodge City, Kansas resigned from office in December 2020 after facing violent threats over her support of a local mask mandate.Governor of South Dakota Kristi Noem has discredited studies and research that support the use of face masks, claiming that they have produced \"very mixed\" outcomes, and arguing that \"the science has not proven what's effective and what isn't and what type of mask. We have to stay objective when we look at it\".On March 10, 2021, Texas lifted its mask mandate and capacity restrictions, in a move that was considered premature by critics and other politicians following its announcement. The lifting of the mandate also includes a prohibition on enforcing mask mandates; on the day the orders took effect, the Texas Attorney General threatened to sue the city of Austin, Texas for intending to continue its mask mandate. The number of new cases and hospitalizations in Texas had already begun to decline in the weeks following the announcement, with an UNT Health Science Center professor believing that residents continuing to follow health guidance, as well as vaccination progress and immunity, may have also been factors.At the start of the new school year in August 2021, political conflicts over mask mandates in schools intensified in Florida and Texas, whose governors had both issued executive orders explicitly prohibiting schools and school boards from implementing mask mandates. This is despite recommendations by the CDC that masks be worn in schools due to the threat of Delta variant, as no current vaccine is approved for children under 12. Governor DeSantis warned that the state would withhold funding from schools and school boards that chose to mandate masks, and also threatened to withhold the wages from school officials responsible for implementing mask mandates. A number of districts in both states announced that they would defy the orders and still mandate masks. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona sent letters to Governor Abbott and Governor DeSantis, expressing concern that their decisions to prohibit voluntary compliance with CDC recommendations \"may infringe upon a school district's authority to adopt policies to protect students and educators as they develop their safe return to in-person instruction plans required by Federal law.Legal challenges against school mask mandates in Texas had gone both ways, which led to confusion over their legality. Paris Independent School District attempted to bypass the Texas executive order by declaring its mask mandate to officially be an amendment to the dress code for students and faculty. On August 19, the Supreme Court of Texas temporarily denied a request by Governor Abbott to block a lower court ruling that had upheld school mask mandates.\n\n\n=== Summary of orders and recommendations issued by states ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nNormalization of deviance \u2013 one reason people stop using effective prevention measures\n\n\n== References ==",

                "content": "Anti-mask or anti-masking laws are legislative or penal initiatives prohibiting the concealment of one's face in public. Anti-mask laws vary widely between jurisdictions in their intent, scope, and penalties.\n\n\n== North America ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nThere are anti-mask laws in many U.S. states and the District of Columbia.\nNew York State's anti-mask law was enacted in 1845, to provide for public safety after disputes between landlords and tenants.\nMany anti-mask laws date back to the mid-20th century, when states and municipalities passed them to stop the violent activities of the Ku Klux Klan, whose members typically wore hoods of white linen to conceal their identities.\nIn the 21st century those laws have been applied to political protesters such as those affiliated with the Occupy Movement or Anonymous \u2013 wearing Guy Fawkes masks.These laws have been challenged on the grounds that they violate the guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to free speech and free association.  Some courts have weighed freedom of speech against the public safety interest, and upheld such laws.  For example, the Georgia Supreme Court found the law constitutional on the grounds that the wearing of the mask was an act of intimidation and a threat of violence, which is not protected speech.  That law has exceptions for holiday celebrations, theatre performances, and occupational safety; the ruling makes it unclear if someone is violating the law if they wear a mask without the intent to threaten violence.  A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a New York law on the ground that wearing a Ku Klux Klan mask did not convey a protected message beyond that conveyed by wearing a hood and robe.  Other courts have struck down anti-mask laws.  For example, Tennessee and Florida state laws have been invalidated on the grounds that they were unconstitutionally broad. An ordinance in Goshen, Indiana, was struck down based on First Amendment doctrine that specifically protects anonymous speech and anonymous association, especially for unpopular groups like the KKK.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nAfter several high-profile protests, the Canadian Parliament introduced Bill C-309, which bans the wearing of masks during a riot or other unlawful assembly. The bill became law on June 19, 2013.\nCanada's Criminal Code, Section 351(2),  also covers \"Disguise with Intent\", whereby \"Every one who, with intent to commit an indictable offence, has his face masked or coloured or is otherwise disguised is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years\". With some exceptions, an indictable offence in Canada is one that is subject to a fine of greater than $5,000 or imprisonment of more than six months.\nin 2017 a Quebec ban on face covering for transition and government services became publicized.\n\n\n== Europe ==\n\nThe present table provides a non-exhaustive overview comparing legal restrictions of face coverings in European states. The 2010 French ban on face covering is widely regarded as the most strict, prohibiting face coverings in almost all situations in public places, as opposed to limited restrictions in countries such as Denmark that only outlaws such practices in the context of public assemblies such as demonstrations.\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nIn Austria since 2002 masking ban on demonstrations under \u00a7 9 of the Assembly Law (Versammlungsgesetz). Violation of the ban need not be prosecuted if the mask does not threaten public order and security. Violation of the ban entails, according to \u00a7 19a.b of the Law, imprisonment up to six months, repeated offenses one year or a fine.\nParliament approved new legislation on 16 May 2017, which stipulates that people who wear clothing that covers their faces, such as burqas, niqabs, full face helmets or scarves (motorcyclists) etc. in places like universities, public transportation or courthouses will face fines of 150 euros (about $167). The measure took effect in October 2017. Shortly after the enactment on 1 October 2017, there were some incidents in which people were incorrectly fined by the police, leading some commentators to point out flaws in the law, or incorrect understanding of it amongst the police.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nA Belgian law adopted in June 2011 prohibits appearing in public \"with a face masked or hidden, in whole or in part, in such a way as to be unidentifiable\". Violations can result in fines and up to seven days in jail. On 11 July 2017 the ban in Belgium was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after having been challenged by two Muslim women who claimed their rights had been infringed.\n\n\n=== Denmark ===\nWearing masks during assemblies in a public place is illegal in Denmark. The Danish penal code (Straffeloven) \u00a7 134 b, which was inserted with effect from 3 June 2000, makes the violation punishable by a fine or up to six months imprisonment. Part 2 of \u00a7 134 b further criminalizes the possession of effects which must be viewed as intended to be used for masking in an assembly. The \u00a7134 b, part 3, exempts from penalty masking which is done to protect one's face against the weather. The ban does not apply in Greenland or the Faroe Islands.\n\n\n=== France ===\nThe French ban on face covering is an act of parliament passed by the Senate of France on 14 September 2010, resulting in the ban on the wearing of face-covering headgear, including masks, helmets, balaclava, niq\u0101bs and other veils covering the face in public places, except under specified circumstances.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nSince 1985, according to \u00a7 17a Abs. 2 Versammlungsgesetz it is prohibited to disguise one's identity in public meetings such as demonstrations so as to prevent identification by police. This violation can be fined with imprisonment up to one year.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy, a law issued in 1975 strictly forbids wearing of any attire that could hide the face of a person. Penalties (fines and imprisonment) are provided for such behaviour. The original purpose of the anti-mask law was to prevent crime or terrorism. The law allows for exemptions for a \"justified cause\", which has sometimes been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons for wearing a veil, but others \u2013including local governments\u2013 disagree and claim religion is not a \"justified cause\" in this context.\n\n\n=== Latvia ===\nIn Latvia, a law issued in 2016 to ban niqab and burqa in entire country was passed by Latvian parliament.\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nIn the Netherlands, a first attempt towards a partial prohibition on face covering was made from 2012 to 2015, but the bill was struck down. A new attempt was made in the years after when a new bill was submitted on 27 November 2015. Eventually a limited anti-mask law was passed on 26 June 2018. The law is called Instelling van een gedeeltelijk verbod op het dragen van gezichtsbedekkende kleding in het onderwijs, het openbaar vervoer, overheidsgebouwen en de zorg (Wet gedeeltelijk verbod gezichtsbedekkende kleding) (\"Introduction of a partial ban on the wearing of face-covering clothing in education, public transport, governmental buildings and healthcare (Partial Face-Covering Clothing Ban Act)\"). It is illegal to wear clothing which covers the entire face, or covered up to the point where only the eyes are uncovered, or renders the face unrecognisable, on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions. Frequently cited examples are a full face helmet, a balaclava, a burqa or a niq\u0101b. Clothes exempt from the Act are:\n\nthose worn by clients, patients or their visitors in residential parts of healthcare institutions;\nthose necessary for the protection of the body in relation to health or security;\nthose necessary in relation to the requirements made to the performance of a profession or sport.On 26 June 2018, the bill was passed in the Dutch Senate.\n\n\n=== Norway ===\nConcealment of faces in public is legal in Norway, except when taking part in a public event.\nExempted from the prohibition of concealment in public events are participants in theatre, masquerade or similar. In accordance with the Norwegian police law, violation is punishable by a fine or up to three months imprisonment.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\nAccording to a Russian federal law \"On assemblies, meetings, demonstrations, marches and picketing\", Article 6 as of June 2012:\nit is prohibited to wear masks and \"any other means of hiding identity during public events;\nthe organizer of an event must require all the people taking part not to use any means of hiding identity.The punishment for the violation of the given law was introduced in July 2014 and is provided by the federal code on administrative offences.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\nAccording to the November 2013 Citizens' Security Law (Ley mordaza), demonstration protesters who cover their faces may be fined up to \u20ac30,000.\n\n\n=== Sweden ===\nAccording to the 2005 'Law on the Prohibition of masking in some cases', it is prohibited for participants in the demonstration to fully or partially cover the face in a way that complicates identification. This prohibition applies only if there are disturbances of public order at demonstrations, or if there is an immediate danger of such disturbances. The ban does not apply to the covering of the face for religious reasons. It also does not apply to the extent participants are authorized (under 2 Ch. 7 a \u00a7 Order Act) to fully or partially cover the face.\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nIn the cantons of Basel-Stadt (1990), Zurich (1995), Bern (1999), Lucerne (2004), Thurgau (2004), Solothurn (2006) and St. Gallen (2009), there are laws banning use of masks [1]\n.\n\n\n=== Ukraine ===\nSeveral days after Berkut riot police clashed with Euromaidan protesters, Verkhovna Rada enacted law 721-VII banning wearing masks, helmets or camouflage clothing by people taking part in a gathering, assembly, demonstration, protest, rally or other mass event. Fines for violating are monetary up to about $400 or administrative arrest up to 15 days. The law was repealed in January 2014.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nFor a century, covering or blacking one's face was a criminal act that could lead to the death penalty; the Black Act was repealed in 1823.\n\n\n== Asia-Pacific ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIt is legal to wear a mask in public in Australia. Motorcycle riders wearing full face helmets are generally required to remove them when entering a bank. A judge in New South Wales has ruled that a woman cannot give evidence in a niq\u0101b. A Victorian judge extended the ban to wearing a niq\u0101b in the public gallery.\nIn 2016, police in Victoria petitioned the government to make it illegal to wear a mask in public unless a person has a valid reason for doing so. This was in the context of alleged violent street demonstrations. It was no longer illegal to wear a mask in public to protect each other from COVID-19.\nNew South Wales police can require a motorist to remove head coverings, including masks, for identification purposes.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n\nOn 4 October 2019, the Government of Hong Kong invoked the rarely used colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance to implement the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation (PFCR), an anti-mask law in response to the ongoing protest that year. The law bans protesters from covering their faces whether in full or partially during protests, including at rallies given a \"Letter of No Objection\" under the Public Order Ordinance. Anyone who wears a mask at a lawful rally or march, unlawful or unauthorised assembly, or during a riot could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and a fine of HK$25,000. Exemptions include those at protests wearing masks for professional or paid work, or for religious or medical reasons.\nIn addition, the law states that anyone who disobeys a police order to remove a mask could be sentenced to six months in jail and a HK$10,000 fine. Paint is also included in the definition of \"face-covering\". The legislation went into effect from midnight on 5 October until further notice, and the Hong Kong High Court refused to rule out an interim injunction order but the court will later decide whether to allow a judicial review into the invocation of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance.In response to the government\u2019s implementation of the law, netizens widely shared a speech by Edward Leung in a televised debate during the 2016 Legco election, \u201cA few years ago, Ukraine passed an anti-mask law. Do you know what happened in Ukraine? A revolution started in Ukraine. You want to do it? Do it, we will fight till the end.\u201d\n\n\n==== Judicial review ====\nOn 18 November 2019, the High Court ruled s3(1)(b), (c), (d) and s5 of the  PFCR failed the proportionality test as they placed restrictions on fundamental rights beyond intended goals. The judgement levelled criticism at various aspects including: the lack of a declared state of emergency to justify invoking the ERO, the law applies to both unlawful and lawful gatherings, the lack of a mechanism to distinguish the two, and the unwarranted breadth of the 'stop and unmask' power granted to police.\nThe court also ruled that the ERO sections empowering the Chief-Executive-in Council to make laws \"on any occasion of public danger\" is incompatible with multiple articles of the Hong Kong Basic Law, however, constitutional status is open to question. The court also held the ordinance meets the \"prescribed by law\" requirement.In response, the government said that it would stop enforcing the ban for the time being. A spokesman from the Chinese legislative affairs commission, however, stated that \"Whether the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region comply with the Basic Law of Hong Kong can only be judged and decided by the standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress\".On 22 November 2019, the High Court made the following remark:\n\"Nevertheless, we recognise that our Judgment is only a judgment at first instance, and will soon be subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal. In view of the great public importance of the issues raised in this case, and the highly exceptional circumstances that Hong Kong is currently facing, we consider it right that we should grant a short interim suspension order so that the respondents may have an opportunity to apply to the Court of Appeal, if so advised, for such interim relief as may be appropriate. Accordingly, we shall grant an interim temporary suspension order to postpone the coming into operation of the declarations of invalidity for a period of 7 days up to the end of 29 November 2019, with liberty to apply.\"On 26 November 2019, the High Court announced hearing for the government appeal against the judgement is on 9 January 2020.On 27 November 2019, the Court of Appeal extended the interim suspension of the judgment until 10 December 2019.On 10 December 2019, the Court of Appeal refused to suspend the \"unconstitutional\" ruling by the Court of First Instance on the anti-mask regulation. As scheduled, a full hearing will commence on 9 January 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNiq\u0101b \u00a7 Enforcement, encouragement and bans\nZentai\nIslamophobia\n\n\n== References ==",

This has led to the popular name Anonymous mask.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was commemorated from early on by burning effigies of unpopular figures. Towards the end of the 18th century, reports appeared of children begging for money with grotesquely masked effigies of Guy Fawkes, and 5 November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Night, although many now prefer the term \"Bonfire Night\". From the 1864 Chambers Book of Days:\n\nThe universal mode of observance through all part of England is the dressing up of a scarecrow figure in such cast-habiliments as can be procured (the head-piece, generally a paper-cap, painted and knotted with paper strips in imitation of ribbons), parading it in a chair through the streets, and at nightfall burning it with great solemnity in a huge bonfire ...\nIn 1847, The Lancet published \"Notes of A Case of Death From Fright,\" in which the death of a two-year-old was attributed to the fright caused by seeing a boy wearing a red Guy Fawkes mask.In the 20th century, in the UK, large numbers of cheap cardboard or paper Guy Fawkes masks were sold to children each autumn or given out free with comics; by the 1980s their popularity became increasingly supplanted by Halloween. In 1958, wearing Guy Fawkes masks was mentioned during a debate in the Parliament of Western Australia as an example of harmless and excusable (though technically unlawful) possession of a face mask at night. J.J. Brady said, \"at one time it was traditional to wear masks on Guy Fawkes night. So, if tonight anyone is found wearing a Guy Fawkes mask I, as Minister for Police, will see that he is duly excused.\"The comic book series V for Vendetta, which started in 1982, \"centers on a vigilante's efforts to destroy an authoritarian government in a dystopian future United Kingdom\". Its main character wears a Guy Fawkes mask, and in the climax of the 2005 film adaptation, thousands of protesters adopt the same costume as they march on Parliament.When developing the story, illustrator David Lloyd made a handwritten note: \"Why don't we portray him as a resurrected Guy Fawkes, complete with one of those papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks, in a cape and a conical hat? He'd look really bizarre and it would give Guy Fawkes the image he's deserved all these years. We shouldn't burn the chap every Nov. 5th but celebrate his attempt to blow up Parliament!\" Writer Alan Moore commented that, due to Lloyd's idea, \"All of the various fragments in my head suddenly fell into place, united behind the single image of a Guy Fawkes mask.\" He also noted \"how interesting it was that we should have taken up the image right at the point where it was apparently being purged from the annals of English iconography.\"\n\n\n== Adoption by protesters ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nSince the 2005 release of the film V for Vendetta, the use of Guy Fawkes masks has become widespread internationally among groups protesting against politicians, banks, and financial institutions. The masks both conceal the identity and protect the face of individuals and demonstrate their commitment to a shared cause.The character developed as an Internet meme, common on imageboards such as 4chan as well as on video-sharing based Web sites such as YouTube. Initially the character, a stick figure who failed at everything, emerged and became known as \"Epic Fail Guy\" (EFG). For reasons that have never been explained, it was increasingly shown as wearing a V for Vendetta Guy Fawkes mask (though this is likely a reference to the fact that Guy Fawkes failed to complete the gunpowder plot).On 17 April 2006 a pair of rival groups wearing Fawkes masks confronted each other outside the New York City offices of Warner Brothers and DC Comics. One group, led by freegan Adam Weismann, protested against a perceived misrepresentation of the Anarchist movement in the film V for Vendetta. The other group, led by libertarian Todd Seavey, counter-protested against the anarchists, wearing masks purportedly supplied by a Time Warner employee.In April 2016 Anonymous for the Voiceless was created; they also use the mask while spreading veganism.\n\n\n=== Anonymous ===\n\nThe mask became associated with the hacktivism group Anonymous's Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology in 2008. The group protested the Church of Scientology in response to the Church forcing YouTube to pull a video of Tom Cruise discussing Scientology that was meant for internal use within the Church. In response, Anonymous protested the litigious methods of the Church of Scientology over a period of several months. Protesters were encouraged to hide their faces, since it was common practice for Church members to photograph anti-Scientology protesters. The Guy Fawkes mask was a widely used method of hiding faces.As the protests continued, more protesters began opting to use the Guy Fawkes mask, which eventually took on symbolic status within the group. Scott Stewart of University of Nebraska at Omaha's The Gateway wrote: \"Many participants sported Guy Fawkes masks to draw attention both to their identity as Anonymous and the Church of Scientology's abuse of litigation and coercion to suppress anti-Scientology viewpoints.\" The Internet-based group then adopted the character for its wider protests against authority.\n\n\n=== Wider use in popular protest ===\nOn 23 May 2009, protesters wearing the mask detonated a fake barrel of gunpowder outside Parliament while protesting over the issue of British MPs' expenses.During the 2011 Wisconsin protests, and then during the subsequent Occupy Wall Street and the ongoing Occupy movement, the mask appeared internationally as a symbol of popular rebellion. In October 2011, campaigner Julian Assange attended the Occupy London Stock Exchange protest wearing such a mask, which he removed after a request by the police.\n\nIn January 2012, Guy Fawkes masks were used by protesters against Poland's signing of ACTA.On 10 June 2012, in Mumbai, India, a group of 100 Anonymous members and college students gathered at Azad Maidan, dressed all in black and wearing Guy Fawkes masks, to protest against the Indian Government's censorship of the Internet.The mask, used by Bahraini protesters during the Arab Spring-inspired Bahraini uprising, was banned in the country in February 2013, a few months after a similar decision by United Arab Emirates, another Persian Gulf country. The Industry and Commerce Ministry of Bahrain said the ban on importing the mask, which it referred to as \"revolution mask\", was due to concerns over \"public safety\". The decision, described by Voice of America as \"unusual\", marked one of the latest in government efforts to suppress the two-year-old uprising. However, a British-based rights activist and Samuel Muston of The Independent downplayed the effect of the ban. The Manama Voice reported that use of mask in protests increased following the ban.The masks were used by anti-government protesters in Thailand in 2012, and by protesters in Turkey in 2013. They were also used in protests in Brazil and Egypt in 2013.In May 2013, the government of Saudi Arabia banned the importation of the masks, and said it would confiscate any found to be for sale. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs stated that the mask is \"a symbol of rebels and revenge\", and warned imams and parents that \"they could be used to incite the youth to destabilize security and spread chaos ...\" On 22 September 2013, Saudi religious police prohibited the wearing of the Guy Fawkes mask, the day before Saudi Arabia's 83rd National Day.The wearing of masks during a riot or unlawful assembly has been banned in Canada, following the enactment of Bill C-309, and now carries a maximum ten-year prison sentence.Participants in the 2014 Venezuelan protests carried a wide variety of masks; one of them was the Guy Fawkes mask, sometimes painted with the colours of the Venezuelan flag.In October 2019 protesters in Hong Kong started using the mask in opposition to the government's banning the use of masks during protests.Guy Fawkes masks were among the symbols displayed during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol.\n\n\n=== Views of Moore and Lloyd ===\nAlan Moore, anarchist and author of V for Vendetta, has supported use of the mask, and stated in a 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, \"I was also quite heartened the other day when watching the news to see that there were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters over here, and that they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing V for Vendetta Guy Fawkes masks. That pleased me. That gave me a warm little glow.\" Whilst Moore did not create such a character for the purposes it has served he explains to The Guardian, \"suppose when I was writing V for Vendetta I would in my secret heart of hearts have thought: wouldn't it be great if these ideas actually made an impact? So when you start to see that idle fantasy intrude on the regular world ... It's peculiar. It feels like a character I created 30 years ago has somehow escaped the realm of fiction.\"V for Vendetta illustrator and co-creator David Lloyd:\n\nThe Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny \u2013 and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way. My feeling is the Anonymous group needed an all-purpose image to hide their identity and also symbolise that they stand for individualism \u2013 V for Vendetta is a story about one person against the system. We knew that V was going to be an escapee from a concentration camp where he had been subjected to medical experiments but then I had the idea that in his craziness he would decide to adopt the persona and mission of Guy Fawkes \u2013 our great historical revolutionary.\n\n\n=== Sales and corporate ownership of rights ===\nAccording to Time in 2011, the protesters' adoption of the mask had led to it becoming the top-selling mask on Amazon.com, selling hundreds of thousands a year. WarnerMedia, which owns Warner Bros. and DC Comics, owns the rights to the image and is paid a fee with the sale of each official mask.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnti-mask law\nRichard Nixon mask\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Masks of Guy Fawkes at Wikimedia Commons",

If the person dies, the post is marked \"awarded\". The subreddit also flags users who show pictures of their COVID-19 vaccination cards as \"Immunized to Prevent Award\" (IPA).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nHerman Cain, a prominent Republican businessman and former presidential candidate, publicly denied the serverity of COVID-19 and spread COVID-19 misinformation during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, he attended a Trump rally in Tulsa where many participants did not engage in social distancing or mask wearing. Cain tested positive for COVID nine days later and was hospitalized, before eventually dying of the disease on July 30. One month after his death, his Twitter account stated, in a since-deleted tweet, that \"It looks like the virus is not as deadly as the mainstream media first made it out to be\", which was met with considerable mockery online. Cain's name \"became synonymous with the grandstanding hubris of the MAGA movement\", given the apparent irony of Cain downplaying a disease that had killed him.\n\n\n=== Origin of Award ===\nAccording to Business Insider, the subreddit \"was originally focused on people who were against wearing masks or didn't believe the deadly virus was dangerous.\" and that \"Early posts created by founder and moderator FBAHobo were about politicians like Nashville Metro Council member Tony Tenpenny and Arkansas GOP county chair Steven Farmer, who both died from COVID complications.\" According to Le Monde, \"In its early days, HCA was primarily fueled by articles found in the press.\", but that \"in recent months, the examples have been drawn directly from a Facebook page of Covid-19 victims. Publication after publication, the pattern invariably repeats itself: one person (anonymized to respect Reddit rules) says all the bad things they think about vaccines, masks, or sometimes even doubts the existence of the pandemic. Often the memes (humorous diversions) used to illustrate mistrust of the vaccine are the same. The following screenshot tells us that the person has just fallen ill, and sometimes that the illness does not really give them a break. Calls to pray for help may follow, before a loved one finally announces the death.\"On September 7, 2021, a member of r/HermanCainAward alleged that other members of the subreddit were doxing and harassing family members of recently deceased COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n== Award recipients ==\nMany award recipients are unnamed individuals whose likeness has been obscured. The community of reviewers  comes to learn of the \u2018awardee\u2019 through screenshots of their social media posts about COVID. Award recipients often post the same sorts of memes and statements. Common talking points among award winners are that Anthony Fauci is a villain, people who take COVID vaccines are like laboratory rats in an experiment, people who support political liberalism are like sheep, immigrants spread disease much more than citizens, and vaccine mandates are comparable to the Nazi treatment of the Jewish people in The Holocaust. These talking points are frequently illustrated with memes containing racist, homophobic, and transphobic ideas or imagery. Additionally, award winners may compare themselves to lions who are proud and free, or share tips on arguing with waiting staff at restaurants that require guests to wear masks.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSubscriptions to the subreddit grew from 2,000 on July 4, 2021, to 5,000 in early August, to more than 100,000 on September 1, to 243,000 on September 17, to 276,000 on September 21, to 339,000 on September 29, to more than 350,000 on October 7, to more than 375,000 on October 16, and to about 438,000 on December 23. According to the moderators of the subreddit, as of October 2021, r/HermanCainAward has nearly 1 million unique daily visitors. Also according to the moderators, 2,393 people have been nominated for the award, 2,515 people have received the award, and 71 people have received IPAs.WebMD has described the subreddit as turning \"death notices from public announcements into a cudgel for public shaming of sorts.\" According to Gita Jackson of Vice, \"Although the Herman Cain Award wasn't created to encourage people to get vaccinated, it's helping anti-vaxxers change their minds.\" According to Deccan Herald, the subreddit \"has been at the centre of debates and discussions on ethics and morality, with many calling for Reddit to take it down\" and that \"The award is seen by many others as dehumanising anti-vaxxers/maskers as they too grieve the loss of their loved ones who died from not masking up or getting jabbed.\"Lydia Dugdale, director of the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said that it is \"not surprising that people would delight on the misfortune of others\" but that \"Delighting in the suffering of others lies contrary to everything medical ethics espouses and certainly it's cruel that regular people would do this.\" F. Diane Barth, a psychotherapist writing for NBC News, described the subreddit as \"A dark and sardonic corner of the internet\" that \"captures the rage and outrage of presumably vaccinated, mask-wearing individuals, many of whom have either been infected with Covid-19 in the past or have watched friends and family become ill \u2014 and even die.\" Barth also described \"This push to revel in schadenfreude, and to assign collective blame\" as \"understandable and more than a little expected, especially on the internet. But this so-called award also captures the collective loss of empathy that colors so many of our political and personal conversations right now. Like soldiers who have been trained to see their enemies as less than human, we have forgotten that those who disagree with us are, despite everything, still people.\"In an interview with Business Insider, Rocky Moose, one of the subreddit's moderators, said that the subreddit was \"an emotional outlet born out of frustration\" and that \"COVID misinformation kills. We're documenting a pandemic of the unvaccinated\".\nOn October 16, 2021, CNBC reported that the subreddit had convinced some readers to get vaccinated against COVID-19. CNBC also reported that r/HermanCainAward was the tenth fastest growing subreddit over the previous thirty days, according to FrontPageMetrics.com, a website that tracks usage of Reddit.\nWhen asked about the subreddit by The Washington Post, Herman Cain's daughter Melanie Cain Gallo responded in an email stating: \"I had not heard about this, and it has no effect on our family because that group is insignificant and irrelevant.\"The Independent compared r/HermanCainAward to the Darwin Awards.\nThe subreddit has inspired a Twitter account of the same name.\nOn September 27, 2021, a Reddit spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement that they were \"closely reviewing the COVID-related communities on our platforms for violations of our policies, including r/HermanCainAward.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

                "summary": "A surgical mask, also known by other names such as a medical face mask or procedure mask, is a personal protective equipment used by healthcare professionals that serves as a mechanical barrier that interferes with direct airflow in and out of respiratory orifices (i.e. nose and mouth). This helps reduce airborne transmission of pathogens and other aerosolized contaminants between the wearer and nearby people via respiratory droplets ejected when sneezing, coughing, forceful expiration or unintentionally spitting when talking, etc. Surgical masks may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental or medical procedure masks.Although the material of which surgical masks are made will filter out some viruses and bacteria by trapping the aerosol suspended in breathed air, they only provide partial protection from airborne diseases because of the typically loose fit between the mask edges and the wearer's face. Surgical masks are distinct from filtering respirators, such as those made to the American N95 standard, which are more airtight and purposefully designed to protect against finer airborne particles.\n\nEvidence from randomized controlled trials that surgical masks reduce infection from diseases such as influenza and COVID-19 is weak. Although a recent very large (over 300,000 people) study found some evidence that they reduced transmission in the community. However, surgical masks can vary greatly in quality which may make these studies less useful. The effect of surgical masks is partially attributed to filtering out some of aerosol particles that are how airborne diseases are transmitted. Surgical masks are highly variable but the material of which they are made typically filter out more aerosol particles than do cloth masks but much less than does the material of which N95, FFP2 and similar masks, are made. This combined with the poor fit suggests that surgical masks offer some protection to airborne diseases such as COVID-19 but less than do N95, FFP2 and similar masks.\nThere are standards for the materials masks are made from. For example, the European EN 14683 Type II standard requires the material of the mask to filter particles (mean diameter close to 3 micrometres) containing the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The bacterial filtration efficiency of the mask material is the fractional reduction in the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) when the aerosol is passed through the material. For a Type II mask under this standard, the material must filter enough of the aerosol particles containing the bacteria to achieve a CFU reduction of at least 98%.\nASTM International has an F2100 standard with similar bacterial filtering standard to the European Type II standard but in addition uses a test aerosol of 0.1 micrometre particles. The Level 3 standard F2100 standard requires that these particles must be filtered out with at least 98% efficiency.

Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nA surgical mask serves as a mechanical barrier that interferes with direct airflow in and out of respiratory orifices (i.e. nose and mouth). Most commonly used surgical masks are designed to only trap respiratory droplets, and therefore do not filter or block fine airborne particles that are smaller than the designed filtration ratings, which may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, unintentional spitting during talking, or certain aerosol-generating medical procedures (e.g. bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy or dental procedures).  Surgical masks also cannot provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the often loose fit between the mask edges and the wearer's face, especially when the mask is worn outright incorrectly (e.g. low with the nose and/or mouth exposed).\nA surgical mask is a disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the respiratory tract openings (nose and mouth) of the wearer and potentially pathogenic contaminants in the immediate environment. If worn properly, surgical masks are meant to help block out most (if not all) large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria, keeping them from entering the wearer's nose and mouth., and conversely are also effective barriers for retaining large droplets released from the wearer's the mouth and nose. Surgical masks help reduce exposure of the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions to others that could otherwise travel up to 7.9 metres (26 ft). Surgical mask also remind wearers not to touch their mouth or nose, which could otherwise transfer viruses and bacteria after having touched a contaminated surface.A surgical mask is not to be confused with a respirator (which is specifically rated for sub-micron particles) and is not certified as such. Surgical masks are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators, which are designed for this purpose. Collection efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% for different manufacturers\u2019 masks when measured using the test parameters for NIOSH certification.  However, a study found that even for surgical masks with \"good\" filters, 80\u2013100% of subjects failed an OSHA-accepted qualitative fit test, and a quantitative test showed 12\u201325% leakage.Modern surgical masks are made from paper or other non-woven material and should be discarded after each use.\n\n\n=== Physical form ===\n\nThe design of the surgical masks depends on the intended usages.  Usually, the masks are rectangular-shaped with pleats to allow the wearer to expand and curve the mask so it can better cover all the area from the nose to around the chin.  The outward-facing side of the mask are typically colored (usually blue, green or yellow) and made thicker, tougher and water-impermeable.  The inner layers of the mask are made of three-ply (three layers) melt-blown polymer (most commonly polypropylene) placed between non-woven fabric.  The melt-blown material acts as the filter that stops microbes from penetrating and exiting the mask.  Some masks have an attached thin polyethylene faceshield (known as \"splash shield\") to provide additional spray protection over the eye area.\nA different type of masks, known as \"duckbill\" masks, uses a trapezoid pouch-like design that has significantly shortened side edges \u2014 sometimes none at all \u2014 to minimize loose gaps that pathogens can leak past.  These masks are typically made to the N95/P2 standards, and are commonly used for clinical situations that demand fine particulates protection, such as tuberculosis.\nSmall strips of foam or thickened fabric are often sewn along the top edge of the mask to help better seal away exhaled water vapors (which can fog up eyewears and faceshields) and soak up excess perspiration dripping from above.  Small bendable metal strips are frequently added to the top edge to better fit over the nasal bridge.  Occasionally adhesive tapes can also be added to secure the seal and prevent the mask from slipping up and down.\nThe masks are typically fastened to the head with straps or elastic bands that are attached to the mask's four corners.  Straps come in four free-hanging ribbons that are manually tied in two pairs horizontally around the back of the head, and are most frequently used in surgical operations due to the ability to customize the strap length and tension comfortably to the wearer's face shape and head movements.  Elastic bands come in a pair of loops that can either be horizontally or vertically attached.  Horizontal loops go around the head like tied straps, designed to exert tension on the top and bottom edges of the mask for firmer contact seal, and are usually seen on duckbill masks; while vertical loops hook around the ears with less tension (due to the weaker rigidity of the elastocartilaginous auricles compared to the bony skull) and thus less firmly secured to the face, but are more popular in non-procedural usages due to the ease of putting on and taking off.\nFilter material in the middle layer may be made of microfibers with an electrostatic charge; that is, the fibers are electrets. An electret filter increases the chances that smaller particles will veer and hit a fiber, rather than going straight through (electrostatic capture). While there is some development work on making electret filtering materials that can stand  being washed and reused, current commercially produced electret filters are ruined by many forms of disinfection, including washing with soap and water or alcohol, which destroys the electric charge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities issued guidelines on how to save, disinfect and reuse electret-filter masks without damaging the filtration efficiency. Standard disposible surgical masks are not designed to be washed.\n\n\n=== Physical properties and quality ===\nPerformance of surgical masks is evaluated based on such parameters as filtration (mask capture of exhaled aerosols), exposure (transfer of aerosols from outside), mask airflow resistance (pressure difference during breathing, \u0394P, also known as breathability), liquid penetration resistance, air and water vapor permeability, water repellency (for outer and inner surfaces).Filtration and exposure is typically measured in bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) using particles of size 3.0 \u03bcm. Particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) using particles of size 0.3 \u03bcm is only measured in China.\n\n\n== History ==\nFace masks for use in surgery were developed in Europe by several physicians, including Jan Mikulicz-Radecki at the University of Breslau and Paul Berger in Paris, in the late nineteenth century, as a result of increasing awareness of germ theory and the importance of antiseptic procedures in medicine. In response to a pneumonic plague in Manchuria and Mongolia in 1910, Chinese-Malaysian epidemiologist Dr. Wu Lien-teh greatly improved on the designs he had seen in Europe to develop a face mask of layers of gauze and cotton that would protect both the wearer and others.\nModern surgical masks began to be used in the 1960s.  Their adoption caused cloth facemasks, which had been used since the late 19th century, to completely fall out of use in the developed world.  However, cloth masks and surgical masks both continued to be used in developing countries.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nAs the pandemic raged on, healthcare workers were required to continue wearing surgical masks for 12 or more hours a day. This caused the ear loops of the masks to chafe the back of their ears. Ear savers, plastic straps and hooks that go around wearer's heads, were invented to move the ear loops away from the wearer's ears. They could be made on demand by using 3D printing process.\n\n\n== Use ==\n\n\n=== Healthcare workers ===\n\nA surgical mask is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and certain health care procedures to catch microorganisms shed in liquid droplets and aerosols from the wearer's mouth and nose. Evidence supports the effectiveness of surgical masks in reducing the risk of infection among other healthcare workers and in the community. However, a Cochrane review found that there is no clear evidence that disposable face masks worn by members of the surgical team would reduce the risk of wound infections after clean surgical procedures.Healthcare workers are trained in how to put on, handle, remove, and dispose of surgical masks. For healthcare workers, safety guidelines recommend the wearing of a face-fit tested N95 or FFP3 respirator mask instead of a surgical mask in the vicinity of pandemic-flu patients, to reduce the exposure of the wearer to potentially infectious aerosols and airborne liquid droplets.\n\n\n=== General public ===\n\nIn community and home settings, the use of facemasks and respirators generally are not recommended, with other measures preferred such as avoiding close contact, maintaining good hand hygiene, and wearing cloth face coverings.Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles created by air pollution.In Japan and Taiwan, it is common to see these masks worn during the flu season, as a show of consideration for others and social responsibility. Surgical masks provide some protection against the spread of diseases, and improvised masks provide about half as much protection.More recently, due to the rising issue of smog in South and Southeast Asia, surgical masks and air filtering face masks are now frequently used in major cities in India, Nepal and Thailand when air quality deteriorates to toxic levels. Additionally, face masks are used in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore during the Southeast Asian haze season. Air filtering surgical-style masks are quite popular across Asia and as a result, many companies have released masks that not only prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles but are also fashionable.Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture.Surgical masks may also be worn to conceal identity. In the United States banks, convenience stores, etc. have banned their use as a result of criminals repeatedly doing so, but allowed facemasks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests, some protestors wore surgical masks amongst other types of mask to avoid recognition, and the government tried to ban such use.Research carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic found that surgical masks increase the attractiveness of the wearer and this is more so than other types of masks.\n\n\n== Research and development ==\nResearchers are developing face-masks which may help reduce viral spread better than existing ones and/or have possibly useful properties such as biodegradability or better breathability. Some are exploring whether attachments could be added to existing face-masks to make them more effective such as due to virus-deactivating fabrics or impregnations. The COVID-19 pandemic increased efforts to develop such masks.There also is an experimental face mask with an embedded biosensor that can detect a pathogenic signature (such as one of SARS-CoV-2) and face masks that glow under ultraviolet light if they contain SARS-CoV-2 when the filter is taken out and sprayed with a fluorescent dye that contains antibodies from ostrich eggs.Other research investigated environmental pollution associated with face mask waste management and weak spots of masks with product designs of the widely applied FFP standards, in particular variants with exhalation valves.\n\n\n== Regulation ==\n\nIn the United States, surgical masks are cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the European Economic Area (EEA), surgical masks have to be certified through the CE marking process in order to be commercialized. CE marking of surgical masks involves the respect of many obligations indicated in the Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulation 2017/745 of 5 April 2017 concerning medical devices, OJ No L 117/1 of 2017-05-05).\nSurgical masks for use in the US and the EEA conform to ASTM F2100 and EN 14683 respectively. In both standards, a mask must have a Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE) of more than 95%, for an aerosol of particles of size approximately 3.0 \u03bcm.In China, two types of masks are common: surgical masks that conform to YY 0469 standard (BFE \u2265 95%, PFE \u2265 30%, splash resistance) and single-use medical masks that conform to YY/T 0969 standard (BFE \u2265 95%). Daily protective masks conforming to GB/T 32610 standard is yet another type of masks that can have similar appearance to surgical masks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDust mask\nNose filter\nSterilization (microbiology)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFiltering out confusion.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, their use in developed countries was revived due to shortages, as well as for environmental concerns and practicality. Launderable cloth electret filters were also being developed.\n\n\n== Usage ==\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, reusable cloth face masks were predominantly used by healthcare workers in developing countries and were especially prominent in Asia.  Cloth face masks contrast with surgical masks and respirators such as N95 masks, which are made of nonwoven fabric formed through a melt blowing process, and are regulated for their effectiveness based upon efficiency of minimum particle size filtered and/or maximum penetrating particle (MPP) size, along with other criteria such as outer splash/spray protection, inner splash/spray absorption, contaminant accumulation and shedding, air flow, and inflammability. Like surgical masks, and unlike respirators, cloth face masks do not provide a seal around the face, and prior to the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak were generally not authorized by institutions for protection from sub-HEPA particle size (less than 0.3 um) Influenza Like Illness (ILI).In healthcare settings, they are used on sick patients as source control to reduce disease transmission through respiratory droplets, and by healthcare workers when surgical masks and respirators are unavailable. Cloth face masks are only recommended for use by healthcare workers as a last resort if supplies of surgical masks and respirators are exhausted.   They are also used by the general public in household and community settings as perceived protection against both infectious diseases and particulate air pollution and to contain the wearer's exhaled virus laden droplets.Several types of cloth face masks are available commercially, especially in Asia.   Homemade masks can also be improvised using bandanas, T-shirts, handkerchiefs, scarves, or towels.\n\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that cloth face masks should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus. It notes that wearing a cloth face mask is just one of a range of tools that can be used to reduce the risk of transmission.  The US Center for Disease Control, along with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, The Mayo Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic all concur with this recommendation. The World Health Organization also recommended that those aged over 60 years old or with underlying health risks require more protection and should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission.The World Health Organization recommends using masks with at least three layers of different materials. Two spunbond polypropylene layers are also believed to offer adequate filtration and breathability. When producing cloth face masks, two parameters should be considered: filtration efficiency of the material and breathability.\nThe filter quality factor known as \"Q\" is commonly used as an integrated filter quality indicator. It is a function of filtration efficiency and breathability, with higher values indicating better performance. Experts recommend Q-factor of three or higher.A peer-reviewed summary of the filtration properties of cloth and cloth masks concluded that, pending further research, evidence is strongest for 2 to 4 layers of plain weave cotton or flannel, at least 100 thread count.  A plain-language summary of this review is available.\n\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nCloth face masks can be used for source control to reduce disease transmission arising from the wearer's respiratory droplets, but are not considered personal protective equipment for the wearer as they typically have very low filter efficiency. There are no standards or regulation for self-made cloth face masks.As of 2015, there had been no randomized clinical trials or guidance on the use of reusable cloth face masks.  Most research had been performed in the early 20th century, before disposable surgical masks became prevalent.  One 2010 study found that 40\u201390% of particles in the 20\u20131000 nm range penetrated a cloth mask and other fabric materials. The performance of cloth face masks varies greatly with the shape, fit, and type of fabric, as well as the fabric fineness and number of layers.  As of 2006, no cloth face masks had been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as surgical masks. A Vietnamese study of healthcare workers compared influenza-like illness outcome among those wearing cloth masks versus medical masks. They concluded that cloth masks were ineffective at preventing transmission in high-risk clinical settings. Although discouraged in clinical settings, cloth masks may still serve a useful role in reducing disease transmission in public settings according to a systematic review.The primary role of masks worn by the general public is to \"stop those who are already infected broadcasting the virus into the air around them.\" This is of particular importance with the COVID-19 pandemic, as silent transmission seems to be a key feature of its rapid spread.  For example, of the people on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 634 people were found to be infected\u201452% had no symptoms at the time of testing, including 18% who never developed symptoms. It is important to note that mask wearers are more likely to engage in other hygiene measures such as hand washing and social distancing. Best practice is to implement multiple prevention techniques to reduce risk, as characterized by the Swiss cheese model.Compared with bacteria recovery from unmasked volunteers, a mask made of muslin and flannel reduced bacteria recovered on agar sedimentation plates by 99%, total airborne microorganisms by 99%, and bacteria recovered from aerosols (<4 \u00b5m) by 88% to 99%. In 1975, 4 medical masks and 1 commercially produced reusable mask made of 4 layers of cotton muslin were compared. Filtration efficiency, assessed by bacterial counts, was 96% to 99% for the medical masks and 99% for the cloth mask; for aerosols (<3.3 \u00b5m), it was 72% to 89% and 89%, respectively.An experiment carried out in 2013 by Public Health England, that country's health-protection agency, found that a commercially made surgical mask filtered 90% of virus particles from the air coughed out by participants, a vacuum cleaner bag filtered out 86%, a tea towel blocked 72% and a cotton t-shirt 51%\u2014though fitting any DIY mask properly and ensuring a good seal around the mouth and nose is crucial.  The use of common fabrics in making face masks has been tested. Filter efficiency can be improved with multiple layers, high weave density, and a mix of different types of fabrics. Cotton is the most commonly used material, and filter efficiencies can reach >80% for particles <300 nm with fabric combinations such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, or cotton-flannel. The most protective cloth masks need at least three layers with a hydrophilic inner layer (e.g. cotton) to absorb moisture from the wearer's breathing and hydrophobic outer layers (e.g. polyester). Masks should be cleaned after each use. They can either be laundered or hand-washed in soapy hot water and dried with high heat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn Roman times, Pliny the Elder recommended that miners use animal bladders to protect against inhaling lead oxides. Some followers of Jainism, which originated in India around 500 B.C.E, wear cloth masks to avoid accidentally inhaling insects as part of practicing ahimsa. In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci advised the use of a wet woven cloth to protect against toxic agents of chemical warfare. In the early modern period, the plague-doctor costume included a beaked face-mask worn to protect the wearer from infectious \"miasma\".\nConventional cowboy attire in the American West often included a bandanna, which could protect the face from blown dust and also potentially doubled as a means of obscuring identity.In 1890 William Stewart Halsted pioneered the use of rubber gloves and surgical face masks, although some European surgeons such as Paul Berger and Jan Mikulicz-Radecki had worn cotton gloves and masks earlier. These masks became commonplace after World War I and the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. Cloth face masks were promoted by Wu Lien-teh in the 1910\u201311 Manchurian pneumonic plague outbreak, although Western medics doubted their efficacy in preventing the spread of disease.Cloth masks were largely supplanted by modern surgical masks made of nonwoven fabric in the 1960s, although their use continued in developing countries.  They were used in Asia during the 2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak, and in West Africa during the 2013\u20132016 Ebola epidemic. Compared with bacteria recovery from unmasked volunteers, a mask made of muslin and flannel reduced bacteria recovered on agar sedimentation plates by 99%, total airborne microorganisms by 99%, and bacteria recovered from aerosols (<4 \u00b5m) by 88% to 99%. In 1975, 4 medical masks and 1 commercially produced reusable mask made of 4 layers of cotton muslin were compared. Filtration efficiency, assessed by bacterial counts, was 96% to 99% for the medical masks and 99% for the cloth mask; for aerosols (<3.3 \u00b5m), it was 72% to 89% and 89%, respectively.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries recommended the use of cloth masks to reduce the spread of the virus.On June 5, 2020, WHO changed its advice on face masks, recommending that the general public should wear fabric masks   where widespread COVID-19 transmission exists and physical distancing is not possible (for example, \"on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments\"). A synthesis of literature in a 2020 pre-print concluded that \"The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nNose filter\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCDC Mask Guidance \u2013 Help Slow the Spread\nNPR: 3 Tips for Safer Face Masks\nMayo Clinic expert on nonmedical mask use to prevent public transmission",

This word is of uncertain origin, perhaps from Arabic maskharah \u0645\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u06c3\u064c \"buffoon\", from the verb sakhira \"to ridicule\".  However, it may also come from Proven\u00e7al mascarar \"to black (the face)\" (or the related Catalan mascarar, Old French mascurer).  This in turn is of uncertain origin \u2013 perhaps from a Germanic source akin to English \"mesh\", but perhaps from mask- \"black\", a borrowing from a pre-Indo-European language. One German author claims the word \"mask\" is originally derived from the Spanish m\u00e1s que la cara (literally, \"more than the face\" or \"added face\"), which evolved to \"m\u00e1scara\", while the Arabic \"maskharat\" \u2013 referring to the buffoonery which is possible only by disguising the face \u2013 would be based on these Spanish roots. Other related forms are Hebrew masecha= \"mask\"; Arabic maskhara \u0645\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e = \"he ridiculed, he mocked\", masakha \u0645\u064e\u0633\u064e\u062e\u064e = \"he transfomed\" (transitive).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe use of masks in rituals or ceremonies is a very ancient human practice across the world, although masks can also be worn for protection, in hunting, in sports, in feasts, or in wars \u2013 or simply used as ornamentation. Some ceremonial or decorative masks were not designed to be worn. Although the religious use of masks has waned, masks are used sometimes in drama therapy or psychotherapy.One of the challenges in anthropology is finding the precise derivation of human culture and early activities, with the invention and use of the mask only one area of unsolved inquiry. The use of masks dates back several millennia. It is conjectured that the first masks may have generally been used by primitive people to associate the wearer with some kind of unimpeachable authority, such as \"the gods\" or to otherwise lend credence to the person's claim on a given social role.\nThe oldest masks that have been discovered are 9,000 years old, being held by the Mus\u00e9e \"Bible et Terre Sainte\" (Paris), and the Israel Museum (Jerusalem). Most probably the practice of masking is much older \u2013 the earliest known anthropomorphic artwork is circa 30,000\u201340,000 years old. However, insofar as it involved the use of war-paint, leather, vegetative material, or wooden masks, the masks probably have not been preserved; they are visible only in paleolithic cave drawings, of which dozens have been preserved. At the neanderthal Roche-Cotard site in France, a flintstone likeness of a face was found which is about 35,000 years old, but it is not clear that it was intended as a mask.In the Greek bacchanalia and the Dionysus cult, which involved the use of masks, the ordinary controls on behaviour were temporarily suspended, and people cavorted in merry revelry outside their ordinary rank or status. Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non claims that in the Roman saturnalia festivals, the ordinary roles were often inverted. Sometimes a slave or a criminal was temporarily granted the insignia and status of royalty, only to be killed after the festival ended. The Carnival of Venice, in which all are equal behind their masks, dates back to 1268 AD. The use of carnivalesque masks in the Jewish Purim festivities probably originated in the late 15th century, although some Jewish authors claim it has always been part of Judaic tradition.The North American Iroquois tribes used masks for healing purposes (see False Face Society). In the Himalayas, masks functioned above all as mediators of supernatural forces. Yup'ik masks could be small 3-inch (7.6 cm) finger masks, but also 10-kilogram (22 lb) masks hung from the ceiling or carried by several people. Masks have been created with plastic surgery for mutilated soldiers.Masks in various forms \u2013 sacred, practical, or playful \u2013 have played a crucial historical role in the development of understandings about \"what it means to be human\", because they permit the imaginative experience of \"what it is like\" to be transformed into a different identity (or to affirm an existing social or spiritual identity). Not all cultures have known the use of masks, but most of them have.\n\n\n== Masks in performance ==\n\nThroughout the world, masks are used for their expressive power as a feature of masked performance \u2013 both ritually and in various theatre traditions. The ritual and theatrical definitions of mask usage frequently overlap and merge but still provide a useful basis for categorisation. The image of juxtaposed Comedy and Tragedy masks are widely used to represent the Performing Arts, and specifically drama.\nIn many dramatic traditions including the theatre of ancient Greece, the classical Noh drama of Japan (14th century to present), the traditional Lhamo drama of Tibet, Talchum in Korea, and the Topeng dance of Indonesia, masks were or are typically worn by all the performers, with several different types of mask used for different types of character.\nIn Ancient Rome, the word persona meant 'a mask'; it also referred to an individual who had full Roman citizenship. A citizen could demonstrate his or her lineage through imagines, death masks of the ancestors. These were wax casts kept in a lararium, the family shrine. Rites of passage, such as initiation of young members of the family, or funerals, were carried out at the shrine under the watch of the ancestral masks. At funerals, professional actors would wear these masks to perform deeds of the lives of the ancestors, thus linking the role of mask as a ritual object and in theatre.\nMasks are a familiar and vivid element in many folk and traditional pageants, ceremonies, rituals, and festivals, and are often of an ancient origin. The mask is normally a part of a costume that adorns the whole body and embodies a tradition important to the religious and/or social life of the community as whole or a particular group within the community. Masks are used almost universally and maintain their power and mystery both for their wearers and their audience. The continued popularity of wearing masks at carnival, and for children at parties and for festivals such as Halloween are good examples. Nowadays these are usually mass-produced plastic masks, often associated with popular films, TV programmes, or cartoon characters \u2013 they are, however, reminders of the enduring power of pretence and play and the power and appeal of masks.\n\n\n== Ritual masks ==\nRitual masks occur throughout the world, and although they tend to share many characteristics, highly distinctive forms have developed. The function of the masks may be magical or religious; they may appear in rites of passage or as a make-up for a form of theatre. Equally masks may disguise a penitent or preside over important ceremonies; they may help mediate with spirits, or offer a protective role to the society who utilise their powers. Biologist Jeremy Griffith has suggested that ritual masks, as representations of the human face, are extremely revealing of the two fundamental aspects of the human psychological condition: firstly, the repression of a cooperative, instinctive self or soul; and secondly, the extremely angry state of the unjustly condemned conscious thinking egocentric intellect.In parts of Australia, giant totem masks cover the body.\n\n\n=== Africa ===\n\nThere are a wide variety of masks used in Africa. In West Africa, masks are used in masquerades that form part of religious ceremonies enacted to communicate with spirits and ancestors. Examples are the masquerades of the Yoruba, Igbo, and Edo cultures, including Egungun Masquerades and Northern Edo Masquerades. The masks are usually carved with an extraordinary skill and variety by artists who will usually have received their training as an apprentice to a master carver \u2013 frequently it is a tradition that has been passed down within a family through many generations. Such an artist holds a respected position in tribal society because of the work that he or she creates, embodying not only complex craft techniques but also spiritual/social and symbolic knowledge. African masks are also used in the Mas or Masquerade of the Caribbean Carnival.\nDjol\u00e9 (also known as Jol\u00e9 or Yol\u00e9) is a mask-dance from Temine people in Sierra Leone. Males wear the mask, although it does depict a female.\n\nMany African masks represent animals. Some African tribes believe that the animal masks can help them communicate with the spirits who live in forests or open savannas. People of Burkina Faso known as the Bwa and Nuna call to the spirit to stop destruction. The Dogon of Mali have complex religions that also have animal masks. Their three main cults use seventy-eight different types of masks. Most of the ceremonies of the Dogon culture are secret, although the antelope dance is shown to non-Dogons. The antelope masks are rough rectangular boxes with several horns coming out of the top. The Dogons are expert agriculturists and the antelope symbolizes a hard-working farmer.Another culture that has a very rich agricultural tradition is the Bamana people of Mali. The antelope (called Chiwara) is believed to have taught man the secrets of agriculture. Although the Dogons and Bamana people both believe the antelope symbolises agriculture, they interpret elements the masks differently. To the Bamana people, swords represent the sprouting of grain.\nMasks may also indicate a culture's ideal of feminine beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped eyes and a narrow chin. The raised strip running from both sides of the nose to the ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. The whiteness of the face represent the whiteness and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the masks representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.The Senoufo people of the Ivory Coast represent tranquility by making masks with eyes half-shut and lines drawn near the mouth. The Temne of Sierra Leone use masks with small eyes and mouths to represent humility and humbleness. They represent wisdom by making bulging forehead. Other masks that have exaggerated long faces and broad foreheads symbolize the soberness of one's duty that comes with power. War masks are also popular. The Grebo of the Ivory Coast and Liberia carve masks with round eyes to represent alertness and anger, with the straight nose to represent unwillingness to retreat.\n\nToday, the qualities of African art are beginning to be more understood and appreciated. However, most African masks are now being produced for the tourist trade. Although they often show skilled craftsmanship, they nearly always lack the spiritual character of the traditional tribal masks.\n\n\n=== Oceania ===\nThe variety and beauty of the masks of Melanesia are almost as highly developed as in Africa. It is a culture where ancestor worship is dominant and religious ceremonies are devoted to ancestors. Inevitably, many of the mask types relate to use in these ceremonies and are linked with the activities of secret societies. The mask is regarded as an instrument of revelation, giving form to the sacred. This is often accomplished by linking the mask to an ancestral presence, and thus bringing the past into the present.\nAs a culture of scattered islands and peninsulars, Melanesian mask forms have developed in a highly diversified fashion, with a great deal of variety in their construction and aesthetic. In Papua New Guinea, six-metre-high totem masks are placed to protect the living from spirits; whereas the duk-duk and tubuan masks of New Guinea are used to enforce social codes by intimidation. They are conical masks, made from cane and leaves.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\nArctic Coastal groups have tended towards simple religious practice but a highly evolved and rich mythology, especially concerning hunting. In some areas, annual shamanic ceremonies involved masked dances and these strongly abstracted masks are arguably the most striking artifacts produced in this region.\nInuit groups vary widely and do not share a common mythology or language. Not surprisingly their mask traditions are also often different, although their masks are often made out of driftwood, animal skins, bones, and feathers.  In some areas Inuit women use finger masks during storytelling and dancing.Pacific Northwest Coastal indigenous groups were generally highly skilled woodworkers. Their masks were often master-pieces of carving, sometimes with movable jaws, or a mask within a mask, and parts moved by pulling cords. The carving of masks was an important feature of wood craft, along with many other features that often combined the utilitarian with the symbolic, such as shields, canoes, poles, and houses.\nWoodland tribes, especially in the North-East and around the Great Lakes, cross-fertilized culturally with one another. The Iroquois made spectacular wooden \u2018false face\u2019 masks, used in healing ceremonies and carved from living trees. These masks appear in a great variety of shapes, depending on their precise function.\nPueblo craftsmen produced impressive work for masked religious ritual, especially the Hopi and Zuni. The kachinas, god/spirits, frequently take the form of highly distinctive and elaborate masks that are used in ritual dances. These are usually made of leather with appendages of fur, feathers or leaves. Some cover the face, some the whole head and are often highly abstracted forms. Navajo masks appear to be inspired by the Pueblo prototypes.In more recent times, masking is a common feature of Mardi Gras traditions, most notably in New Orleans. Costumes and masks (originally inspired by masquerade balls) are frequently worn by krewe members on Mardi Gras Day. Laws against concealing one's identity with a mask are suspended for the day.\n\n\n=== Latin America ===\n\nDistinctive styles of masks began to emerge in pre-Hispanic America about 1200BC, although there is evidence of far older mask forms. In the Andes, masks were used to dress the faces of the dead. These were originally made of fabric, but later burial masks were sometimes made of beaten copper or gold, and occasionally of clay.\nFor the Aztecs, human skulls were prized as war trophies, and skull masks were not uncommon. Masks were also used as part of court entertainments, possibly combining political with religious significance.\nIn post-colonial Latin America, pre-Columbian traditions merged with Christian rituals, and syncretic masquerades and ceremonies, such as All Souls/Day of the Dead developed, despite efforts of the Church to stamp out the indigenous traditions. Masks remain an important feature of popular carnivals and religious dances, such as The Dance of the Moors and Christians. Mexico, in particular, retains a great deal of creativity in the production of masks, encouraged by collectors. Wrestling matches, where it is common for the participants to wear masks, are very popular, and many of the wrestlers can be considered folk heroes. For instance, the popular wrestler El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealed his face briefly only in old age, and was buried wearing his silver mask.\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n\n==== China ====\n\nIn China, masks are thought to have originated in ancient religious ceremonies. Images of people wearing masks have been found in rock paintings along the Yangtze. Later mask forms brings together myths and symbols from shamanism and Buddhism.Shigong dance masks were used in shamanic rituals to thank the gods, while nuo dance masks protected from bad spirits. Wedding masks were used to pray for good luck and a lasting marriage, and \"Swallowing Animal\" masks were associated with protecting the home and symbolised the \"swallowing\" of disaster. Opera masks were used in a basic \"common\" form of opera performed without a stage or backdrops. These led to colourful facial patterns that we see in today's Peking opera.\n\n\n==== India/Sri Lanka/Indo-China ====\nMasked characters, usually divinities, are a central feature of Indian dramatic forms, many based on depicting the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. Countries that have had strong Indian cultural influences \u2013 Cambodia, Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, and Lao \u2013 have developed the Indian forms, combined with local myths, and developed their own characteristic styles.\nThe masks are usually highly exaggerated and formalised, and share an aesthetic with the carved images of monstrous heads that dominate the facades of Hindu and Buddhist temples. These faces or Kirtimukhas, 'Visages of Glory', are intended to ward off evil and are associated with the animal world as well as the divine. During ceremonies, these visages are given active form in the great mask dramas of the South and South-eastern Asian region.\n\n\n==== Indonesia ====\n\nIn Indonesia, the mask dance predates Hindu-Buddhist influences. It is believed that the use of masks is related to the cult of the ancestors, which considered dancers the interpreters of the gods. Native Indonesian tribes such as Dayak have masked Hudoq dance that represents nature spirits. In Java and Bali, masked dance is commonly called topeng and demonstrated Hindu influences as it often feature epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharata. The native story of Panji also popular in topeng masked dance. Indonesian topeng dance styles are widely distributed, such as topeng Bali, Cirebon, Betawi, Malang, Yogyakarta, and Solo.\n\n\n==== Japan ====\n\nJapanese masks are part of a very old and highly sophisticated and stylized theatrical tradition. Although the roots are in prehistoric myths and cults, they have developed into refined art forms. The oldest masks are the gigaku. The form no longer exists, and was probably a type of dance presentation. The bugaku developed from this \u2013 a complex dance-drama that used masks with moveable jaws.\nThe n\u014d or noh mask evolved from the gigaku and bugaku and are acted entirely by men. The masks are worn throughout very long performances and are consequently very light. The n\u014d mask is the supreme achievement of Japanese mask-making. N\u014d masks represent gods, men, women, madmen and devils, and each category has many sub-divisions. Ky\u014dgen are short farces with their own masks, and accompany the tragic n\u014d plays. Kabuki is the theatre of modern Japan, rooted in the older forms, but in this form masks are replaced by painted faces.\n\n\n==== Korea ====\n\nKorean masks have a long tradition associated with shamanism and later in ritual dance. Korean masks were used in war, on both soldiers and their horses; ceremonially, for burial rites in jade and bronze and for shamanistic ceremonies to drive away evil spirits; to remember the faces of great historical figures in death masks; and in the arts, particularly in ritual dances, courtly, and theatrical plays. The present uses are as miniature masks for tourist souvenirs, or on mobile phones, where they hang as good-luck talismans.\n\n\n=== Middle East ===\n\nTheatre in the Middle East, as elsewhere, was initially of a ritual nature, dramatising man's relationship with nature, the gods, and other human beings. It grew out of sacred rites of myths and legends performed by priests and lay actors at fixed times and often in fixed locations. Folk theatre \u2013 mime, mask, puppetry, farce, juggling \u2013 had a ritual context in that it was performed at religious or rites of passage such as days of naming, circumcisions, and marriages. Over time, some of these contextual ritual enactments became divorced from their religious meaning and they were performed throughout the year. Some 2500 years ago, kings and commoners alike were entertained by dance and mime accompanied by music where the dancers often wore masks, a vestige of an earlier era when such dances were enacted as religious rites. According to George Goyan, this practice evoked that of Roman funeral rites where masked actor-dancers represented the deceased with motions and gestures mimicking those of the deceased while singing the praise of his life (see  Masks in Performance above).\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nMasks are used throughout Europe, and are frequently integrated into regional folk celebrations and customs. Old masks are preserved and can be seen in museums and other collections, and much research has been undertaken into the historical origins of masks. Most probably represent nature spirits, and as a result many of the associated customs are seasonal. The original significance would have survived only until the introduction of Christianity which then incorporated many of the customs into its own traditions. In the process their meanings were also changed so, for example, old gods and goddesses were, literally, demonised and were viewed as mere devils, subjugated to the Abrahamic God.\nMany of the masks and characters used in European festivals belong to the contrasting categories of the 'good', or 'idealised beauty', set against the 'ugly' or 'beastly' and grotesque. This is particularly true of the Germanic and Central European festivals. Another common type is the Fool, sometimes considered to be the synthesis of the two contrasting type of Handsome and Ugly.The oldest representations of masks are animal masks, such as the cave paintings of Lascaux in the Dordogne in southern France. Such masks survive in the alpine regions of Austria and Switzerland, and may be connected with hunting or shamanism, and tend to be particularly associated with the New Year and Carnival festivals.\nThe debate about the meaning of these and other mask forms continues in Europe, where monsters, bears, wild men, harlequins, hobby horses, and other fanciful characters appear in carnivals throughout the continent. It is generally accepted that the masks, noise, colour and clamour are meant to drive away the forces of darkness and winter, and open the way for the spirits of light and the coming of spring. In Sardinia existed the tradition of Mamuthones e Issohadores of Mamoiada; Boes e Merdules of Ottana; Thurpos of Orotelli; S'Urtzu, Su 'Omadore and Sos Mamutzones of Samugheo.\nAnother tradition of European masks developed, more self-consciously, from court and civic events, or entertainments managed by guilds and co-fraternities. These grew out of the earlier revels and had become evident by the 15th century in places like Rome, and Venice, where they developed as entertainments to enliven towns and cities. Thus the Maundy Thursday carnival in St Marks Square in Venice, attended by the Doge and aristocracy also involved the guilds, including a guild of maskmakers. There is evidence of 'commedia dell'arte'-inspired Venetian masks and by the late 16th century the Venetian Carnival began to reach its peak and eventually lasted a whole 'season' from January until Lent. By the 18th century, it was already a tourist attraction, Goethe saying that he was ugly enough not to need a mask. The carnival was repressed during the Napoleonic Republic, although in the 1980s its costumes and the masks aping the C 18th heyday were revived. It appears other cities in central Europe were influenced by the Venetian model.\nDuring the Reformation, many of these carnival customs began to die out in Protestant regions, although they seem to have survived in Catholic areas despite the opposition of the ecclesiastical authorities. So by the 19th century, the carnivals of the relatively wealthy bourgeois town communities, with elaborate masques and costumes, existed side by side with the ragged and essentially folkloric customs of the rural areas. Although these civic masquerades and their masks may have retained elements drawn from popular culture, the survival of carnival in the 19th century was often a consequence of a self-conscious 'folklore' movement that accompanied the rise of nationalism in many European countries. Nowadays, during carnival in the Netherlands masks are often replaced with face paint for more comfort.\nIn the beginning of the new century, on 19 August 2004, the Bulgarian archeologist Georgi Kitov discovered a 673 g gold mask in the burial mound \"Svetitsata\" near Shipka, Central Bulgaria. It is a very fine piece of workmanship made out of massive 23 karat gold. Unlike other masks discovered in the Balkans (of which 3 are in Republic of Macedonia and two in Greece), it is now kept in the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia. It is considered to be the mask of a Thracian king, presumably Teres.\n\n\n== Masks in theatre ==\n\nMasks play a key part within world theatre traditions, particularly non-western theatre forms. They also continue to be a vital force within contemporary theatre, and their usage takes a variety of forms.\nIn many cultural traditions, the masked performer is a central concept and is highly valued. In the western tradition, actors in Ancient Greek theatre wore masks, as they do in traditional Japanese Noh drama. In some Greek masks, the wide and open mouth of the mask contained a brass megaphone enabling the voice of the wearer to be projected into the large auditoria. In medieval Europe, masks were used in mystery and miracle plays to portray allegorical creatures, and the performer representing God frequently wore a gold or gilt mask. During the Renaissance, masques and ballet de cour developed \u2013 courtly masked entertainments that continued as part of ballet conventions until the late eighteenth century. The masked characters of the Commedia dell'arte included the ancestors of the modern clown. In contemporary western theatre, the mask is often used alongside puppetry to create a theatre which is essentially visual rather than verbal, and many of its practitioners have been visual artists.\nMasks are an important part of many theatre forms throughout world cultures, and their usage in theatre has often developed from, or continues to be part of old, highly sophisticated, stylized theatrical traditions.\n\n\n=== Contemporary theatre ===\n\nMasks and puppets were often incorporated into the theatre work of European avant-garde artists from the turn of the nineteenth century. Alfred Jarry, Pablo Picasso, Oskar Schlemmer, and other artists of the Bauhaus School, as well as surrealists and Dadaists, experimented with theatre forms and masks in their work.\nIn the 20th century, many theatre practitioners, such as Meyerhold, Edward Gordon Craig, Jacques Copeau, and others in their lineage, attempted to move away from Naturalism. They turned to sources such as Oriental Theatre (particularly Japanese Noh theatre) and commedia dell'arte, both of which forms feature masks prominently.\nEdward Gordon Craig (1872\u20131966) in A Note on Masks (1910) proposed the virtues of using masks over the naturalism of the actor. Craig was highly influential, and his ideas were taken up by Brecht, Cocteau, Genet, Eugene O'Neill \u2013 and later by Arden, Grotowski, and Brook and others who \"attempted to restore a ritualistic if not actually religious significance to theatre\".Copeau, in his attempts to \"Naturalise\" the actor decided to use mask to liberate them from their \"excessive awkwardness\". In turn, Copeau's work with masks was taken on by his students including Etienne Decroux and later, via Jean Daste, Jacques Lecoq. Lecoq, having worked as movement director at Teatro Piccalo in Italy, was influenced by the Commedia tradition. Lecoq met Amleto Satori, a sculptor, and they collaborated on reviving the techniques of making traditional leather Commedia masks. Later, developing Copeau's \"noble mask\", Lecoq would ask Satori to make him masques neutre (the neutral mask). For Lecoq, masks became an important training tool, the neutral mask being designed to facilitate a state of openness in the student-performers, moving gradually on to character and expressive masks, and finally to \"the smallest mask in the world\" the clown's red-nose. One highly important feature of Lecoq's use of mask, wasn't so much its visual impact on stage, but how it changed the performers movement on stage. It was a body-based approach to mask work, rather than a visually led one. Lecoq's pedagogy has been hugely influential for theatre practitioners in Europe working with mask and has been exported widely across the world. This work with masks also relates to performing with portable structures and puppetry. Students of Lecoq have continued using masks in their work after leaving the school, such as in John Wright's Trestle Theatre.\nIn America, mask-work was slower to arrive, but the Guerrilla Theatre movement, typified by groups such as the San Francisco Mime Troupe and Bread and Puppet Theatre took advantage of it. Influenced by modern dance, modern mime, Commedia dell'arte and Brecht such groups took to the streets to perform highly political theatre. Peter Schumann, the founder of Bread and Puppet theatre, made particular use of German Carnival masks. Bread and Puppet inspired other practitioners around the world, many of whom used masks in their work. In the US and Canada, these companies include In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theater of Minneapolis; Arm-of-the Sea Theatre from New York State; Snake Theater from California; and Shadowland Theatre of Toronto, Ontario. These companies, and others, have a strong social agenda, and combine masks, music and puppetry to create a visual theatrical form. Another route masks took into American Theatre was via dancer/choreographers such as Mary Wigman, who had been using masks in dance and had emigrated to America to flee the Nazi regime.\nIn Europe, Schumann's influence combined with the early avant-garde artists to encourage groups like Moving Picture Mime Show and Welfare State (both in the UK). These companies had a big influence on the next generation of groups working in visual theatre, including IOU and Horse and Bamboo Theatre, who create a theatre in which masks are used along with puppets, film and other visual forms, with an emphasis on the narrative structure.\n\n\n== Functional masks ==\nMasks are also familiar as pieces of kit associated with practical functions, usually protective. There has been a proliferation of such masks recently but there is a long history of protective armour and even medical masks to ward off plague. The contrast with performance masks is not always clear-cut. Ritual and theatrical masks themselves can be considered to be practical, and protective masks in a sports context in particular are often designed to enhance the appearance of the wearer.\n\n\n=== Medical ===\n\nSome masks are used for medical purposes:\n\nOxygen mask, a piece of medical equipment that assists breathing.\nAnesthetic mask.\nBurn mask, a piece of medical equipment that protects the burn tissue from contact with other surfaces, and minimises the risk of infection.\nSurgical mask, a piece of medical equipment that helps to protect both the surgeon and patient from acquiring infection from each other.\nFace shield, to protect a medical professional from bodily fluids.\nPocket mask or CPR mask, used to safely deliver rescue breaths during a cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest.\n\n\n=== Protective ===\n\nProtective masks are pieces of kit or equipment worn on the head and face to afford protection to the wearer, and today usually have these functions:\n\nProviding a supply of air or filtering the outside air (respirators and dust masks).\nProtecting the face against flying objects or dangerous environments, while allowing vision.In Roman gladiatorial tournaments masks were sometimes used. From archaeological evidence it is clear that these were not only protective but also helped make the wearer appear more intimidating. In medieval Europe and in Japan soldiers and samurai wore similarly ferocious-looking protective armour, extending to face-masks. In the 16th century, the Visard was worn by women to protect from sunburn. Today this function is attributed to thin balaclavas.\nIn sport the protective mask will often have a secondary function to make the wearer appear more impressive as a competitor.\nBefore strong transparent materials such as polycarbonate were invented, visors to protect the face had to be opaque with small eyeslits, and were a sort of mask, as often in mediaeval suits of armour, and (for example) Old Norse gr\u00edmr meant \"mask or visor\".\n\n\n=== Disguise ===\n\nMasks are sometimes used to avoid recognition. As a disguise the mask acts as a form of protection for the wearer who wishes to assume a role or task without being identified by others.\n\nRobbers and other criminal perpetrators may wear masks as a means in concealing their faces and thus identities from their victims and from law enforcement.\nOccasionally a witness for the prosecution appears in court in a mask to avoid being recognized by associates of the accused.\nParticipants in a black bloc at protests usually wear masks, often bandannas, to avoid recognition, and to try to protect against any riot control agents used.Masks are also used to prevent recognition while showing membership of a group:\n\nMasks are use by penitents in ceremonies to disguise their identity in order to make the act of penitence more selfless. The Semana Santa parades throughout Spain and in Hispanic or Catholic countries throughout the world are examples of this, with their cone-shaped masks known as capirote.\nMasks are used by vigilante groups.\nThe cone-shaped mask in particular is identified with the Ku Klux Klan in a self-conscious effort to combine the hiding of personal identity with the promotion of a powerful and intimidating image.\nMembers of the group Anonymous frequently wear masks (usually Guy Fawkes masks, best known from V for Vendetta) when they attend protests.While the niq\u0101b usually shows membership of some Islamic community, its purpose is not to hinder recognition, although it falls under some anti-mask laws such as the French ban on face covering.\nCloth face masks may also be worn as a piece of apparel; in this context they are  also known as anime masks.\n\n\n=== Occupational ===\nBeaked masks containing herbs in the beak were worn in early modern Europe by plague doctors to try to ward off the Black Death.\nFilter mask, a piece of safety equipment.\nFull-face diving mask as part of self-contained breathing apparatus for divers and others; some let the wearer talk to others through a built-in communication device\nRespirator (gas or particulate mask), a mask worn on the face to protect the body from airborne pollutants and toxic materials, and fine particulate matter or infectious particles.\nOxygen mask worn by high-altitude pilots, or used in medicine to deliver oxygen, anesthetic, or other gases to patients\nWelding mask to protect the welder's face and eyes from the brightness and sparks created during welding\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nAmerican football helmet face mask\nBalaclava, also known as a \"ski mask\", to protect the face against cold air.\nBaseball catcher's mask.\nDiving mask, an item of diving equipment that allows scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater.\nFencing mask.\nGoaltender mask, a mask worn by an ice or field hockey goaltender to protect the head and face from injury.\nHurling helmets were made mandatory in 2010, and have a wire mask on the front to protect the player's face.\nKendo, a mask called Men is used in this Japanese sword-fighting martial art.\nPaintball mask.\nVisor (ice hockey).An interesting example of a sports mask that confounds the protective function is the wrestling mask, a mask most widely used in the Mexican/Latin lucha libre style of wrestling. In modern lucha libre, masks are colourfully designed to evoke the images of animals, gods, ancient heroes, and other archetypes. The mask is considered \"sacred\" to some degree, placing its role closer to the ritual and performance function.\n\n\n== Punitive ==\n\nMasks are sometimes used to punish the wearer either by signalling their humiliation or causing direct suffering:\n\nParticularly uncomfortable types, such as an iron mask, for example the Scold's bridle, are fit as devices for humiliation, corporal punishment or torture.\nMasks were used to alienate and silence prisoners in Australian jails in the late 19th century. They were made of white cloth and covered the face, leaving only the eyes visible.\nUse of masks is also common in BDSM practices.\n\n\n== Fashion ==\n\nDecorative masks may be worn as part of a costume outside of ritual or ceremonial functions. This is often described as a masque, and relates closely to carnival styles. For example, attendants of a costume party will sometimes wear masks as part of their costumes.\nSeveral artists in the 20th and 21st century, like Isamaya Ffrench and Damselfrau, create masks as wearable art.\nWrestling masks are used most widely in Mexican and Japanese wrestling. A wrestler's mask is usually related to a wrestler's persona (for example, a wrestler known as 'The Panda' might wear a mask with a panda's facial markings). Often, wrestlers will put their masks on the line against other wrestlers' masks, titles or an opponent's hair. While in Mexico and Japan, masks are a sign of tradition, they are looked down upon in the United States and Canada.\nSeveral bands and performers, notably members of the groups Slipknot, Mental Creepers and Gwar, and the guitarist Buckethead, wear masks when they perform on stage. Several other groups, including Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Dimmu Borgir simulate the effect with facepaint. Hollywood Undead also wears masks but often remove them mid-performance.\nLeather-working, steampunk, and other methods and themes are occasionally used to create artisanal gas masks.\n\n\n== In works of fiction ==\n\nMasks have been used in many horror films to conceal the identities of the killer.  Notable examples include Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th series, Jigsaw Killer from Saw, Ghostface of the Scream series, and Michael Myers of the Halloween series.\n\n\n== Other types ==\nA \"buccal mask\" is a mask that covers only the cheeks (hence the adjective \"buccal\") and mouth.\nA death mask is a mask either cast from or applied to the face of a recently deceased person.\nA \"facial\" (short for facial mask) is a temporary mask, not solid, used in cosmetics or as therapy for skin treatment.\nA \"life mask\" is a plaster cast of a face, used as a model for making a painting or sculpture.\nAn animal roleplay mask is used for people to create a more animal-like image in fetish role play.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnti-mask law\nCharacter mask\nPareidolia\nDomino mask\nFace masks during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBurch, Ernest S.

The last goaltender to play without a mask was Andy Brown, who played his last NHL game in 1974. He later moved to the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association and played without a mask until his retirement in 1977.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first recorded case of an ice hockey goaltender using a mask was in February of 1927 where a metal fencing mask was donned by Queen's University netminder Elizabeth Graham, mainly to protect her teeth.In 1930, the first crude leather model of the mask (actually an American football \"nose-guard\") was worn by Clint Benedict to protect his broken nose. After recovering from the injury, he abandoned the mask, never wearing one again in his career.\nAt the 1936 Winter Olympics, Japanese ice hockey goaltender Teiji Honma wore a crude mask, similar to the one worn by baseball catchers. The mask was made of leather, and had a wire cage that protected the face, as well as Honma's large circular glasses.\n\n\n=== Jacques Plante ===\n\nIt was not until 1959 that a goaltender wore a mask full-time. On November 1, 1959, in the first period of a game between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) at Madison Square Garden, Canadiens goaltender Jacques Plante was struck in the face by a shot from Andy Bathgate. Plante had previously worn his mask in practice, but head coach Toe Blake refused to allow him to wear it in a game, fearing it would inhibit his vision. After being stitched up, Plante gave Blake an ultimatum, refusing to go back out onto the ice without the mask, to which Blake obliged, not wanting to forfeit the game, since NHL teams did not have back-up goaltenders at the time. Montreal won the game 3\u20131 and continued on an 18-game unbeaten streak, which went through November.In preparation for the playoffs, Plante was asked by Blake to remove it for a game on March 8, a 3\u20130 loss. Plante donned the mask the next night, and for the remainder of his career. When he introduced the mask into the NHL, many questioned his dedication and bravery; in response, Plante made an analogy to a person skydiving without a parachute. Although Plante faced some laughter, the face-hugging fiberglass goaltender mask soon became the standard; by late 1969, only a few NHL goaltenders went without one.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Face-hugging ===\n\nThe face-hugging fiberglass, the type which was worn first by Jacques Plante, is a longtime symbol of ice hockey as typified by the famous painting At the Crease, by Ken Danby. The goaltender mask evolved further from the original face-hugging fiberglass mask designed by Plante. Although this mask does not seem very protective now, at the time it was, based on the style of game that was played.\nGerry Cheevers's use of the face-hugging mask for the Boston Bruins was among the first to be \"decorated\" in a custom manner; as prompted by then-Bruins trainer John \"Frosty\" Forristall as a joke, painting a fake stitch on the mask where Cheevers had been struck by an errant puck. Cheevers adopted the \"stitch mask\" as his own, and went on to set a NHL record (which still stands) of 32-straight wins during the Bruins' 1971\u201372 season.While this style of mask is no longer used by hockey leagues, it has remained famous because of its use in popular culture. Perphaps the best-known example is the character Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th horror film franchise. Casey Jones from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise also wears a stylized version of the mask, as did D-Roc the Executioner, the late guitarist of the heavy metal band Body Count. Similarly, the members of Hollywood Undead are always seen wearing signature masks based on this design. In the film Heat, the protagonists wear face-hugging hockey masks as part of their disguise during a heist, as do the characters in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, during a mission which is heavily inspired by the heist from the film.\n\n\n=== Helmet-cage combination ===\n\nIn the 1970s, a helmet-cage combination was popularized by Vladislav Tretiak. Like the original fiberglass design, the helmet-cage combination has been criticized for not providing adequate facial/cranial protection. Dan Cloutier switched from this type of mask to the more popular full fiberglass citing safety reasons upon the advice of the Los Angeles Kings. Dominik Ha\u0161ek used this type of mask. Rick DiPietro, last with the New York Islanders in 2013, was one of the last NHL goaltenders to use this type of mask. Following Clint Malarchuk's life threatening injury in 1989, more goaltender masks have adopted a plastic extension to guard the neck, usually hanging loose for more maneuverability. On March 4, 2014, Tim Thomas took the ice for the Florida Panthers wearing an old Cooper helmet painted dark blue with a modern Bauer cage and white Itech neck guard attached. During the game, the cage broke from a slapshot and Thomas returned with a red Mage-style helmet with a similar Bauer cage. Goaltenders at lower levels of hockey (such as high-school, college or recreational leagues) who choose to use this design cite reasons such as the plastic helmet used is lighter than the fiberglass or composite materials used in other designs, and that the helmet has a wider opening than a traditional mask for a less claustrophobic feeling and better sight of the puck.\n\n\n=== Fiberglass/cage combination (Combo mask) ===\n\nIn the late 1970s, a second type of goaltender mask with a fiberglass mask with a cage attached in the middle was developed by Dave Dryden and Greg Harrison. It can also be made out of carbon fiber, or a fiberglass and kevlar mix.  Gilles Meloche and Chico Resch were among the first early NHL adopters to the combo mask in the early 1980s.  Today, modern versions of this mask are aerodynamically designed to better withstand the impacts of hockey puck at higher speeds and are used at all levels of organized ice hockey. These masks are considered safer since they disperse the impact of the puck better than the helmet-cage combination and are the most common type used by goaltenders today. Former goaltender Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins wore a newer style one piece called a Sportmask Mage RS, which is made like the newer fiberglass mask, but resembles the helmet/cage combination.  The combo mask was approved for Canadian minor hockey in 1989.  Amateur versions have square bars, as the cats-eye bars are banned in minor hockey.\n\n\n== Tactical play ==\nThe advent of the goaltender mask changed the way goaltenders play, allowing them to make more saves on their knees without fear of serious head or facial injuries. Before the advent of the mask, most goaltenders stayed standing as much as possible. In the modern era, a goaltender is likely to suffer temporary discomfort instead of serious concussions and lacerations; however, a mask does not eliminate all potential risk of injury, and goaltenders have been concussed by a shot hitting the head. Some goaltenders, such as Dominik Ha\u0161ek and Henrik Lundqvist, have used their heads intentionally to stop shots. Lundqvist said that his reason for this is to not obstruct his vision by placing his catching glove in front of his mask to stop the shot.\n\n\n== Mask decoration ==\nWith available surface area provided by fiberglass masks, goaltenders find it fashionable to give their mask distinctive decorations. This tradition started with the earliest masks, notably by the aforementioned, now-retired Boston Bruins goaltender Gerry Cheevers, who was known for drawing stitches on his mask whenever it got hit. These stitches represented where Cheevers would have been cut had he not been wearing his mask. Modern-day masks also offer this ability, and goaltenders are well-identified with their helmet design, often transferring the motif into their new team's colours when traded or signed to a new team (for example, Patrick Lalime's Marvin the Martian theme, F\u00e9lix Potvin's cat theme, Curtis Joseph's Cujo theme, Ed Belfour's eagle theme, Martin Brodeur's Devils theme, Peter Budaj's Ned Flanders theme, Cam Talbot's Ghostbusters theme or John Gibson's Arcade game theme).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Other uses ==\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nIn recent years, baseball catchers have begun wearing facemasks similar in style to goaltender masks. Charlie O'Brien was the first to use a hockey-style catcher's mask in a Major League Baseball game in 1996 while playing for the Toronto Blue Jays.Goaltender masks are commonly seen being worn by box lacrosse, ringette, rinkball, floorball and field hockey goaltenders at both youth and professional levels.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHockey helmet\nGoalie pads\nRingette\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Brief History of the Goalie Mask\nMyPuck Rent a Goalie \u2014 with pictures of goalies in masks",
